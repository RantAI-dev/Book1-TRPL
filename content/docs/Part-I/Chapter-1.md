## 1.1. The TRPLâ€™s Structure

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A pure tutorial takes you through topics step-by-step, making sure you donâ€™t encounter anything you haven't already learned. This means you have to read it from the beginning. On the other hand, a pure reference manual lets you jump in wherever you want, giving short explanations and pointing you to related topics. Tutorials donâ€™t assume you know anything beforehand, while reference manuals are best for people who already know the basics. TRPL book is a mix of both. If you know most of the concepts and techniques, feel free to dip in and out of chapters or sections as needed. If you're new to Rust, start at the beginning but donâ€™t get stuck on every detail. Use the index and cross-references to help you find what you need.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Making sections of the book relatively self-contained means some repetition, but this also helps with review for linear readers. TRPL is extensively cross-referenced, ensuring easy navigation. Experienced programmers can skim the quick "tour" of Rust for an overview to use TRPL as a reference. TRPL is divided into four parts:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Part I lays the foundation, covering Rustâ€™s core principles and practical applications. It starts with Notes to the Reader and moves through the basics of Rustâ€™s syntax, data types, control flow, abstraction mechanisms, standard library collections, memory safety, concurrency, asynchronous and parallel programming, and essential tools like Rustc, Rustup, Cargo, and Crate.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Part II delves into essential concepts for mastering Rustâ€™s approach to memory safety, performance, and expressive programming. It covers types, declaration and mutability, ownership and move semantics, pointers, arrays, references, complex data types (structs, unions, enums), control flow, pattern matching, functions, error handling, and code organization.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Part III focuses on advanced topics, including structs, traits, encapsulation, composition vs. inheritance, generics, macros, pattern matching, and handling collections and multidimensional data structures like vectors and matrices.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Part IV explores essential libraries and advanced techniques for building robust applications. It covers crates, collections, iterators, algorithms, numerics, strings, regular expressions, functional patterns, memory management, concurrency, threads, tasks, parallel programming, asynchronous programming, network utilities, I/O streams, file utilities, and command line interfaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This structure allows both newcomers and experienced programmers to navigate and use TRPL effectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
TRPL focuses on program organization rather than algorithm design. We avoid complex algorithms to illustrate language features and program structure more clearly. Simpler algorithms serve better for these purposes, leaving more suitable algorithms as exercises. In practice, using library functions is usually better than the code examples provided here.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
TRPL examples often simplify complexities that come with larger-scale software development. Writing realistically sized programs helps understand the true nature of programming. TRPL emphasizes Rust's language features and standard-library facilities, highlighting essential techniques for program composition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our examples reflect a background in systems programming and simulations, with simplified versions of real code to keep concepts clear. We aim for the shortest and clearest examples that illustrate design principles, programming techniques, language constructs, or library features. We avoid "cute" examples without real-world counterparts and use straightforward names for purely technical examples.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust language and crates library features are presented in a practical context. We detail what's needed for effective Rust use, showing how features can be combined. Understanding every technical detail isn't necessary for writing good programs. Instead, we focus on design and programming techniques and application domains.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
TRPL uses "pure Rust" as defined by the Rust standard, ensuring compatibility with up-to-date Rust implementations and commonly used crates. Examples using newer Rust features may not compile on all implementations, but implementers are quickly updating their compilers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We use Rust features like the ownership system, lifetimes, and async/await syntax where appropriate. Our goal is the most elegant expression of fundamental ideas, which may involve older Rust features. If you use a pre-Rust 2018 compiler, avoid newer features, but don't assume older methods are better just because they're familiar. Understanding Rust's modern features is key for writing efficient and safe code.
</p>

## 1.2. The Design of Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's role in translating our programming ideas into efficient and clear executable code is pivotal. While C excels in its proximity to hardware and efficiency in managing low-level details, Rust goes further by not only maintaining this efficiency but also elevating safety and expressiveness to new heights. Rust's capability to directly map operations to hardware ensures optimal memory utilization and high-performance execution, essential for demanding system-level tasks. What truly distinguishes Rust are its robust features such as ownership management, lifetimes, and pattern matching, empowering developers to write code that is not only efficient but also inherently safer and more comprehensible. With Rust, memory management issues like null pointer errors and data races are mitigated at compile-time, addressing longstanding challenges in languages like C and C++. This unique blend of performance and safety positions Rust as an ideal choice for developing robust and scalable software systems, especially in fields demanding both low-level control and sophisticated abstraction, such as machine learning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's design embodies simplicity and elegance by focusing on fundamental programming concerns critical to systems programming. Like C++, Rust serves as a versatile general-purpose language, yet with a strong emphasis on system-level tasks. It seamlessly integrates efficient hardware operations with robust features for managing memory, mutability, and resource allocation. While C++ excels in efficiently defining lightweight abstractions, Rust takes it further by prioritizing safety and concurrency through its advanced ownership and type systems. This unique blend allows developers to create secure, efficient code suitable for both resource-constrained environments and high-performance systems. Unlike languages tailored for specific domains, C++ and Rust aim to support a wide range of applications effectively, adapting to diverse programming challenges with their comprehensive toolsets.\
\
In the context of Rust, systems programming involves writing code that directly interacts with hardware resources, operates under tight resource constraints, or interfaces closely with such code. This encompasses tasks like implementing low-level software infrastructure such as device drivers, communication stacks, virtual machines, operating systems, programming environments, and foundational libraries. The emphasis on Rust's "bias toward systems programming" underscores its commitment to not compromising its capabilities aimed at expert-level usage of hardware and system resources, distinguishing it from languages that may sacrifice such capabilities in favor of broader application suitability. While Rust supports abstraction that can hide hardware details or employ high-cost abstractions like dynamic memory allocation and virtual functions, its design ensures efficiency and clarity, maintaining its strength in systems programming contexts without compromising on versatility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Language features in Rust are designed to support diverse programming styles. Rather than viewing each feature in isolation, they should be seen as modular components that can be combined to express comprehensive solutions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The foundational design principles are as follows:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Directly express ideas in Rust code, emphasizing clarity and conciseness.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Encapsulate independent concepts as separate entities in Rust code, promoting modularity and reusability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly define relationships between concepts in Rust code using explicit constructs.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Facilitate flexible and meaningful combinations of ideas in Rust code, ensuring coherence and efficiency.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Keep Rust code straightforward and uncomplicated when expressing simple ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These principles are integral to Rust's design philosophy, reflecting its origins in systems programming and its commitment to managing complexity through safe and efficient abstractions, while also evolving to meet modern software engineering needs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, language features are designed to support several fundamental programming methodologies:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Procedural programming</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Data abstraction</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Object-oriented programming</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Generic programming</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Metaprogramming</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust places significant emphasis on enabling effective combinations of these styles. The most optimal solutions to complex problems often involve blending aspects from each of these approaches to achieve maintainable, readable, and efficient code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In computing, terminology such as "programming style" may vary widely across industry and academia. What we refer to as a "programming style," others may label as a "programming technique" or a "paradigm." We prefer the term "programming technique" for something more specific and tied to particular languages. We find the term "paradigm" somewhat pretentious and often associated with exclusive claims, based on its original definition and usage.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our goal is to provide language features that elegantly support a continuum of programming styles and a diverse array of programming techniques in Rust.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Procedural programming:</strong> This style focuses on processing and designing suitable data structures. Originally championed by languages like C, Algol, and Fortran, Rust extends this paradigm with its own set of built-in types, operators, statements, functions, structs, enums, and more, enhancing safety and concurrency while maintaining low-level control.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data abstraction:</strong> This style emphasizes designing interfaces that hide implementation details and specific representations. Rust supports both concrete and abstract data types, allowing developers to define structs with private fields, methods, and associated traits. Abstract data types in Rust facilitate robust data encapsulation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Object-oriented programming:</strong> While Rust does not strictly adhere to traditional OOP principles, it supports object-like patterns through its trait system and struct definitions. Developers can create reusable components with traits and implement them for various structs, promoting code reuse and maintainability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Generic programming:</strong> This style focuses on designing algorithms and data structures that can work with a variety of types. Rust achieves this through generics, allowing developers to write functions, structs, and enums that can handle different types without sacrificing type safety or performance.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meta programming:</strong> In Rust, meta programming involves techniques where programs manipulate other programs at compile-time. While Rust's meta programming capabilities are not as extensive as languages like C++, it supports compile-time code generation through macros and procedural macros, enabling developers to automate repetitive tasks and achieve high-level abstractions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These styles and techniques are integral to Rust's design philosophy, enabling developers to write efficient, safe, and expressive code across a spectrum of applications, from low-level systems programming to high-level abstractions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's language design philosophy, originally forged by Graydon Hoare and refined through community collaboration, was fundamentally shaped by the goal of addressing the inherent challenges of systems programming with a focus on safety, concurrency, and performance. From its early stages, Rust aimed to provide developers with tools to write reliable software that avoids common pitfalls like null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks. Central to this approach is Rust's ownership system, which ensures strict compile-time checks on memory usage and mutability, thereby guaranteeing memory safety without relying on a garbage collector.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As Rust evolved, its design principles expanded beyond systems programming to encompass broader application domains. While maintaining its emphasis on safety and performance, Rust developers enhanced the language's expressiveness with features like pattern matching, algebraic data types (enums), traits (similar to interfaces), and functional programming constructs. These additions not only improved the clarity and maintainability of Rust code but also made it more adaptable for general-purpose programming tasks, including web development, tooling, and backend services.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The growth of Rust's ecosystem played a crucial role in its transition to a general-purpose language. A vibrant community contributed to the development of libraries, frameworks, and tools that expanded Rust's capabilities and facilitated its adoption in various industries. This ecosystem growth, coupled with Rust's robust tooling support, made it increasingly viable for complex application development scenarios where both safety and performance are critical.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In recent years, Rust has started to make inroads into the field of machine learning, traditionally dominated by languages like Python and C++. Rust's strengths in performance, memory safety, and integration capabilities with existing ML frameworks are appealing to developers seeking efficient and reliable implementations for ML algorithms. While still emerging in this domain, Rust's potential in machine learning is underscored by projects and libraries that leverage its capabilities to handle large-scale data processing, numerical computations, and integration with high-performance computing environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Overall, Rust's evolution from a systems programming language to a versatile tool for general-purpose and emerging domains like machine learning reflects its commitment to combining safety, performance, and expressiveness. As it continues to evolve, Rust is poised to further expand its footprint in diverse application areas, driven by its community-driven development model and robust set of features tailored for modern software development challenges.
</p>

## 1.3. Learning Rust in C/C++ Way
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust, like any programming language, isn't designed to be flawless, but rather as a versatile tool for building a wide range of systems and expressing various programming ideas directly. Recognizing that no single language can excel universally across all tasks, Rust was created to support diverse programming styles and techniques. Mastering Rust involves becoming familiar with its core styles and applying them practically, rather than getting bogged down in every intricate feature. Effective Rust programming involves leveraging language features and standard libraries together to support robust design and implementation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practical terms, spending time on obscure language features or using a multitude of features indiscriminately doesn't offer significant advantages. Features gain their value when integrated with other language elements and programming techniques. Therefore, learning Rust is about understanding how to use its features within cohesive programming styles and sound design principles. Significant software systems aren't solely built from language features but are greatly enhanced by Rust's rich ecosystem of libraries that streamline programming tasks, improve maintainability, and optimize performance. The standard library in Rust encapsulates fundamental programming concepts, making it essential for mastering the language effectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Despite not being the smallest or simplest language, Rust is widely used in education and research because it effectively teaches both foundational and advanced programming concepts. Its realism, efficiency, and flexibility make it suitable for demanding projects and diverse development environments. For those learning Rust, the focus should be on grasping core concepts like ownership, lifetimes, and pattern matching rather than getting lost in technical details. Learning Rust is about becoming proficient in designing, implementing, and maintaining systems effectively through practical experience and application of programming and design techniques.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust programming thrives on strong static type checking and emphasizes achieving high levels of abstraction while directly representing the programmer's intentions. This approach maintains efficiency in terms of runtime performance and memory usage compared to lower-level techniques. Transitioning to Rust from another programming language requires learning and internalizing Rust's idiomatic style and techniques, especially for those accustomed to earlier, less expressive versions of Rust or different programming paradigms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Applying techniques from one language thoughtlessly to Rust often results in awkward, inefficient, and difficult-to-maintain code. Such code can be frustrating to write because it constantly reminds the programmer of the differences between Rust and their previous languages. While ideas from other languages can inspire, they must be adapted to fit Rust's overall structure and type system to be effective.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the ongoing debate about whether one should learn C before Rust, it is generally recommended to start directly with Rust. Rust offers enhanced safety, expressiveness, and reduces the reliance on low-level programming techniques. Learning Rust first allows developers to grasp more complex aspects of lower-level programming languages like C as needed, particularly techniques necessary for working with legacy codebases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are multiple implementations and extensive tooling support for Rust, accompanied by a wealth of resources including textbooks, manuals, and online materials. For those serious about using Rust professionally, accessing multiple sources is advisable due to their varying emphases and biases. This approach helps in mastering Rust comprehensively and effectively leveraging its capabilities across different applications and development environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The question of "How does one write good programs in Rust?" is akin to the question of "How does one write good Indonesian prose?" There are two essential answers: "Understand what you wish to convey" and "Practice and emulate good examples." Both principles are as pertinent to Rust programming as they are to writing in Indonesian, yet equally challenging to master.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust programming, akin to many high-level languages, the primary aim is to seamlessly translate design concepts into executable code. The goal is to ensure that ideas discussed, illustrated on whiteboards, or found in non-programming literature, are faithfully represented in software program:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Translate conceptual thoughts into executable code:</strong> The objective is to fluently convert abstract ideas into practical code, preserving the essence of the design throughout implementation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illuminate connections between concepts:</strong> Code should vividly depict how various ideas relate to each other, whether through hierarchies, parameters, or ownership, fostering a clear understanding of their interactions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implement distinct ideas independently:</strong> Each concept should stand alone within the codebase, promoting modular development and minimizing dependencies between different components.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Simplify mundane tasks, enable intricate solutions:</strong> Emphasize straightforward approaches for basic operations while empowering the implementation of complex functionalities without unnecessary complexity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prefer statically type-checked solutions (when applicable):</strong> Opt for solutions that leverage the compiler's type checking to detect errors at compile-time, ensuring robustness and reliability in the codebase.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Keep information local:</strong> Reduce reliance on global variables and pointers, encapsulating data and behavior within appropriate scopes to enhance code maintainability and readability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Avoid unnecessary abstractions:</strong> Strive to maintain clarity and simplicity in code design by avoiding overgeneralization and excessive use of class hierarchies or parameterizations beyond practical needs.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prioritize readability and maintainability:</strong> Craft code that is easy to comprehend and modify, following consistent naming conventions, comprehensive documentation, and structured organization.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Optimize for performance without sacrificing clarity:</strong> Aim for efficient code while maintaining readability and comprehensibility, leveraging profiling and benchmarking to address performance bottlenecks when necessary.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Promote code reuse and modularization:</strong> Design software components that are modular and reusable, encapsulating functionality in well-defined interfaces to facilitate scalability and integration across different applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These principles serve as guiding lights for Rust programmers, enabling them to create code that accurately reflects their design intentions while enhancing clarity, maintainability, and scalability across diverse development contexts and use cases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For those diving deeper into Rust, it's not just about new features, but how they work together to unlock fresh ways of coding. What might have seemed impractical before can now be the best approach. When exploring Rust resources, go through chapters systematically; even if you think you know them, you might find unexpected insights. Writing this book has been a learning journey for us, and even experienced Rust devs might not know every feature. To master Rust well, you need a structured view that ties everything together. TRPL offers practical examples and a cohesive approach to help you use Rust's modern features effectively:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">When working with Rust, ensuring your objects start off correctly involves using associated functions that act like constructors in other languages. These functions initialize struct fields and enforce object invariants, ensuring that instances are created in a valid state right from the beginning. This approach not only promotes code clarity but also helps in maintaining object integrity throughout their lifecycle.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Efficient resource management in Rust is achieved through its ownership and borrowing system. While Rust does not always require explicit destructors thanks to automatic memory management, complex resources or patterns like RAII can benefit from constructor/destructor pairs. These pairs encapsulate resource allocation and deallocation logic, ensuring that resources are properly managed and released when they go out of scope, thereby preventing memory leaks and improving code reliability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Dynamic memory management in Rust is handled safely and efficiently with constructs like <code>Box</code> and <code>Arc</code>. <code>Box</code> allows for single ownership of dynamically allocated memory, ensuring that memory is automatically reclaimed when no longer needed. <code>Arc</code>, on the other hand, provides thread-safe shared ownership across multiple threads, leveraging Rust's ownership model to prevent data races and ensure safe concurrent access. By relying on these constructs, developers can avoid common pitfalls associated with manual memory management in other languages.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Rust's standard library offers a comprehensive set of collections and algorithms that are designed for reliability and performance. By using these standard tools instead of custom implementations, developers benefit from extensively tested and optimized solutions that integrate seamlessly with Rust's language features. This approach not only simplifies code maintenance but also enhances compatibility across different platforms and environments, ensuring robustness and stability in Rust applications.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Error handling in Rust is robust and expressive, centered around the <code>Result</code> type and the <code>panic!</code> macro. <code>Result</code> encapsulates the outcome of operations that can succeed (<code>Ok</code>) or fail (<code>Err</code>), allowing for explicit and structured error management. Developers can handle errors gracefully using <code>Result</code>, ensuring that error conditions are handled appropriately without compromising program flow. In cases of unrecoverable errors or exceptional conditions, the <code>panic!</code> macro provides a mechanism to abort execution and provide diagnostic information, aiding in debugging and ensuring program integrity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Managing memory wisely is fundamental in Rust, facilitated by its ownership and borrowing rules. These rules enforce strict compile-time checks to prevent common memory-related issues such as null pointer dereferencing and data races. By adhering to these rules, developers can write efficient and safe code without relying on garbage collection or manual memory management techniques. Rust's ownership model ensures that each piece of data has a clear ownership path and allows for temporary borrowing of references, enabling fine-grained control over memory usage and allocation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing data safely across different parts of a Rust codebase is facilitated by <code>Rc</code> (Reference Counting) and <code>Arc</code> (Atomic Reference Counting). <code>Rc</code> enables shared ownership of data when concurrency is not a concern, while <code>Arc</code> extends this capability to concurrent environments by ensuring thread-safe access to shared data. These constructs leverage Rust's ownership model to guarantee data integrity and prevent data races, making it easier to write concurrent programs without compromising safety or performance.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Generics and traits play a crucial role in promoting code reuse and type safety in Rust. Generics allow functions, structs, and enums to work with any data type, reducing code duplication and improving code maintainability. Traits define shared behaviors that types can implement, enabling developers to write polymorphic code that operates on different types in a consistent manner. By embracing generics and traits, developers can write safer, more expressive code that adapts to various requirements and promotes software modularity in Rust projects.</p>
## 1.4. History and Evolution
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare while working at Mozilla Research. He began developing Rust as a personal project in 2006, and Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009. Graydon Hoare, along with significant contributions from the Mozilla team and the open-source community, helped shape Rust into the language it is today. Here is a brief overview of key figures in Rust's development:

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Bjarne Stroustrup, renowned for his work on C++, stresses the direct representation of ideas (concepts) in code. In Rust, this translates to clear expression through functions, structs, enums, and traits, enhancing readability and maintainability by clarifying intent without ambiguity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Graydon Hoare, the founder of Rust, advocates creating efficient and elegant abstractions, encapsulated within libraries. Rust's modularity and comprehensive standard library facilitate the effective construction and utilization of abstractions, simplifying code and improving reusability and maintainability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Directly model relationships among ideas using parameterization, traits, and struct composition, while maintaining independence among components to ensure better modularity and manageability of your codebase.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Embrace Rust's multi-paradigm nature, prioritizing statically checked solutions to leverage its strong type system for compile-time error detection, enhancing code reliability and reducing bugs.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Explicitly manage resources as struct objects to benefit from Rust's ownership and borrowing mechanisms, critical for robust resource management in systems programming.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Keep your code simple and expressive by leveraging Rust's syntax and features, avoiding unnecessary complexity and reinventing solutions already provided by existing libraries, particularly the standard library.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Adopt a type-rich programming style to harness Rust's powerful type system effectively, ensuring robust, error-free code without compromising performance, thanks to Rust's zero-cost abstractions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Encapsulate data invariants using Rust's struct and enum features to maintain data consistency and validity throughout its lifecycle, simplifying debugging and maintenance tasks.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, recognize Rust's unique capabilities and idioms rather than viewing it merely as a variant of C. Embrace its focus on safety, concurrency, and performance to craft software that meets modern demands effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, proficiency in Rust demands intelligence, taste, and patience, echoing the philosophies of Stroustrup and Hoare. Iteratively refine your code, leveraging Rust's supportive tooling and community to grow and innovate in software development effectively. Happy coding!
