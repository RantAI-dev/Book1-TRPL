Chapter 19 of "The Rust Programming Language" delves into the concept of encapsulation, a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that is adeptly applied within the Rust programming language to enhance modularity, safety, and code clarity. Encapsulation in Rust involves organizing code into modules and structs that hide internal implementation details from other parts of the program, promoting a clean separation of concerns. This chapter guides readers through the various mechanisms Rust provides to control access to data and functionality, ensuring that components expose only what is necessary to the outside world while maintaining strict control over their internal state.

## 19.1. Introduction to Encapsulation
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that plays a crucial role in systems programming with Rust. It involves organizing data (variables) and the functions that manipulate that data into a single cohesive unit, often within a module or struct, while controlling the visibility and accessibility of these components. This means that some parts of the data or functionality are hidden from the outside world, which helps prevent unauthorized access and modifications. By restricting access to certain components, encapsulation helps safeguard the internal state of an object and ensures that its interface remains consistent and controlled.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, encapsulation is particularly important because it contributes to the language's strict memory safety model, which is designed to prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows. Unlike languages that rely on a garbage collector, Rust manages memory through a system of ownership and borrowing rules. Encapsulation complements these rules by allowing developers to hide implementation details, thereby reducing the risk of unintended interactions between different parts of a program.
</p>

### 19.1.1. What is Encapsulation?
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation is achieved by controlling the visibility of modules, types, functions, and fields through the use of <code>pub</code> (public) and non-public (private) access modifiers. This visibility control is an essential aspect of Rust's module system, designed to help developers manage the boundaries between different parts of a codebase and maintain clear interfaces between them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By default, all components within a Rust module, such as structs, enums, functions, and their associated fields and methods, are private. This default private visibility means that these components are accessible only within the module where they are defined, preventing external modules from directly interacting with them. This restriction is crucial for preserving the internal state and invariants of types, as it allows developers to hide implementation details that should not be exposed to the outside world. For instance, a module might contain helper functions or internal data structures that are critical for its operation but should not be modified or accessed externally to avoid unintended side effects or misuse.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To expose certain parts of a module's contents to the outside world, Rust provides the <code>pub</code> keyword, which makes a component public and therefore accessible from other modules. By explicitly marking elements as <code>pub</code>, developers can define a clear and controlled interface for their modules, selectively exposing only those components that are intended for public use. This explicit public declaration is a form of deliberate design, where the module's author carefully decides what to make available and what to keep hidden. For example, a library might expose certain functions or types as public API, while keeping the underlying implementation details private to allow for internal changes without breaking external code that relies on the library.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The distinction between public and private elements in Rust is not only a matter of access control but also an important aspect of software design and maintenance. By encapsulating implementation details and providing a well-defined public interface, modules can evolve independently of each other. This separation allows for internal optimizations, refactoring, or bug fixes without affecting the external code that depends on the module's public interface. It also enhances the safety and reliability of the software, as external users cannot inadvertently disrupt the internal state of a module by bypassing its intended usage patterns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, Rust's approach to encapsulation aligns with its overall emphasis on safety and robustness. By defaulting to private visibility, Rust encourages developers to think carefully about what should be exposed and to minimize the surface area of the public API. This conservative approach helps prevent accidental misuse of components and reduces the potential for errors. When public visibility is granted, it is done with full awareness and intention, ensuring that the exposed elements are safe and stable for use.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's a basic example in Rust demonstrating encapsulation with a struct:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod my_module {
    pub struct MyStruct {
        pub public_field: i32,
        private_field: i32,
    }

    impl MyStruct {
        pub fn new() -> MyStruct {
            MyStruct {
                public_field: 5,
                private_field: 10,
            }
        }

        pub fn show_private(&self) {
            println!("Private field: {}", self.private_field);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_instance = my_module::MyStruct::new();
    println!("Public field: {}", my_instance.public_field);
    my_instance.show_private();  // Accessible method that internally accesses a private field
    // println!("Private field: {}", my_instance.private_field); // This will throw an error
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>MyStruct</code> has one public field and one private field. The private field can only be accessed by methods within <code>MyStruct</code>, such as <code>show_private</code>, which safely exposes the value of the private field.
</p>

### 19.1.2. Importance in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation is crucial in Rust for several reasons. It helps in managing complexity by hiding the internal implementation details of a module or a struct and exposing a clean and clear API. This is not only good practice for large software projects but is essential for writing safe and secure code in a systems programming language like Rust. Encapsulation prevents misuse by ensuring that critical data cannot be directly accessed or modified, thus adhering to Rust's strict safety and concurrency guarantees.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, by limiting the visibility of types and their components, encapsulation helps Rust in achieving more aggressive optimizations during compilation, especially when combined with Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing mechanisms. For instance, knowing that a field is not accessed from outside its module, the compiler might optimize the way it is stored or accessed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s a Rust code snippet showcasing encapsulation used in a more complex scenario with enums and error handling:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod network {
    pub struct Server {
        address: String,
        port: u16,
    }

    impl Server {
        pub fn new(address: String, port: u16) -> Self {
            Server { address, port }
        }

        pub fn run(&self) {
            println!("Server running on {}:{}", self.address, self.port);
            // Additional setup and run logic
        }
    }

    pub enum Error {
        ConnectionError,
        Timeout,
        AuthenticationError,
    }

    pub fn connect(server: &Server) -> Result<&Server, Error> {
        if server.port == 22 {
            Err(Error::AuthenticationError)
        } else {
            Ok(server)
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let server = network::Server::new("192.168.1.1".to_string(), 80);
    match network::connect(&server) {
        Ok(s) => s.run(),
        Err(network::Error::AuthenticationError) => println!("Authentication failed"),
        Err(_) => println!("Connection failed"),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this extended example, the <code>Server</code> struct encapsulates the details of a network server, and the <code>connect</code> function provides a controlled way to interact with it, ensuring that errors are handled explicitly, showcasing Rust's capability to combine encapsulation with robust error handling for safer and more reliable code.
</p>

## 19.2. Access Control
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Access control in Rust is a fundamental mechanism that enables the enforcement of encapsulation, providing a structured way to manage the visibility and accessibility of various components within a program. This system dictates how functions, structs, enums, constants, variables, and even modules can be accessed from different parts of a codebase. By precisely defining these boundaries, Rust's access control mechanism helps maintain the integrity of data and behavior, ensuring that only the intended interfaces are exposed for use.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The design of Rust's access control system revolves around the concept of public (<code>pub</code>) and private visibility. By default, all components in Rust are private, meaning they are accessible only within the scope in which they are defined. This default setting serves as a safeguard, preventing unintended interactions with the internal workings of a module. It allows developers to protect the internal state and logic from being altered or accessed inappropriately by other parts of the program. This protection is crucial for preserving the invariants and guarantees that a module might depend on, as it ensures that only the module's defined public interface can be interacted with by external code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>pub</code> keyword in Rust is used to override the default private visibility, making a component accessible from outside its defining scope. This explicit marking of public elements allows developers to carefully control what parts of their code are exposed and under what conditions. By defining a clear public API, a module can specify which components are safe and intended for external use, while keeping other details encapsulated and hidden. This distinction between public and private components is not merely a matter of access; it is a design decision that communicates the intended use of the code and the boundaries of its functionality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's access control also extends to the granularity of modules, which can contain other modules, types, functions, and data. This hierarchical structure allows for fine-grained control over what is visible at different levels of the program. For example, a module can re-export certain components from its submodules, selectively exposing specific parts while keeping others private. This capability is particularly useful for creating libraries or APIs, where a clean and intentional public interface is critical for usability and maintainability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, Rust's access control system is integral to the language's focus on safety and concurrency. By restricting access to data and functions, it minimizes the risk of data races and other concurrency issues. When developers control how data is accessed and modified, they can ensure that the data is only altered in predictable and controlled ways. This control is vital for maintaining the safety guarantees that Rust provides, such as preventing memory corruption and ensuring thread-safe access to shared resources.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition, access control plays a significant role in the modularization and organization of Rust programs. By encapsulating implementation details within modules and exposing only the necessary public components, developers can create well-defined boundaries within their codebase. This modular approach not only makes the code easier to understand and maintain but also facilitates independent development and testing of different parts of the program. Each module can be developed, tested, and debugged in isolation, with confidence that its internal state is protected from external interference.
</p>

### 19.2.1. Using pub and priv Modifiers
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>pub</code> keyword is used to make items public, allowing them to be accessible from other modules or crates. By default, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, etc.) are private. They are only accessible within the module where they are declared. This default helps enforce encapsulation by exposing only necessary parts of the API. Hereâ€™s how you can use <code>pub</code> and <code>priv</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod network {
    pub struct Server {
        pub address: String,
        port: u16,  // Private by default
    }

    impl Server {
        pub fn new(address: String, port: u16) -> Self {
            Server { address, port }
        }

        pub fn run(&self) {
            println!("Running server on {}:{}", self.address, self.port);
        }

        fn restart(&self) {
            println!("Restarting server on {}:{}", self.address, self.port);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let server = network::Server::new("127.0.0.1".to_string(), 8080);
    server.run();
    // server.restart(); // This will result in an error as `restart` is private
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>Server</code> is a public struct with a public <code>address</code> field and a private <code>port</code> field. The <code>new</code> and <code>run</code> methods are public, allowing them to be called from outside the module, whereas <code>restart</code> is private and can only be called within the <code>network</code> module.
</p>

### 19.2.2. Struct Visibility
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Struct visibility in Rust controls whether a struct and its fields can be accessed outside its module. By default, struct fields are private, even if the struct itself is public. This allows the struct to expose a public API while keeping its data hidden, ensuring that internal invariants are maintained.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod authentication {
    pub mod login {
        pub fn sign_in(username: &str) {
            println!("User {} signed in", username);
        }
    }

    mod password {
        fn validate(password: &str) -> bool {
            password.len() > 8
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    authentication::login::sign_in("Alice");
    // authentication::password::validate("password"); // Error: `validate` is private
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This Rust code defines a module <code>authentication</code> containing a public submodule <code>login</code> with a public function <code>sign_in</code>, which prints a sign-in message, and a private submodule <code>password</code> with a private function <code>validate</code> that checks if a password length is greater than 8, demonstrating public and private visibility within modules.
</p>

### 19.2.3. Controlling Access to Module Contents
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Module access control is broader and involves not just structs and functions but also enums, constants, and other modules. By structuring your code into modules with controlled visibility, you can create robust and maintainable code architectures.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod authentication {
    pub mod login {
        pub fn sign_in(username: &str) {
            println!("User {} signed in", username);
        }
    }

    mod password {
        fn validate(password: &str) -> bool {
            password.len() > 8
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    authentication::login::sign_in("Alice");
    // authentication::password::validate("password"); // Error: `validate` is private
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>sign_in</code> function within the <code>login</code> module is publicly accessible, while the <code>validate</code> function within the <code>password</code> module remains private, encapsulating password validation logic within the <code>authentication</code> module.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These mechanisms of access control are fundamental in Rust for building safe and modular applications, allowing developers to define clear interfaces for their code while protecting against misuse.
</p>

## 19.3. Access Control and Encapsulation Patterns
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation in Rust extends beyond the basic concept of restricting access to data; it also encompasses controlling how data can be manipulated and ensuring its integrity over time. This approach involves carefully designing the interface through which external code interacts with the data, typically by combining private fields with public methods. By keeping fields private and providing controlled access through public methods, Rust developers can enforce invariants and manage the internal state in a way that prevents misuse and unintended modifications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Private fields in Rust are a key element of this encapsulation strategy. By default, all fields within a struct are private, accessible only within the module where they are defined. This privacy is crucial because it allows the internal representation of a type to be hidden from the outside world. By not exposing the data directly, developers can change the internal representation without affecting any code that depends on the public API. This flexibility is particularly valuable for maintaining backward compatibility and making internal improvements or optimizations without breaking existing client code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To interact with the private fields, public methods are provided, which serve as the controlled interface for accessing and modifying the data. These methods often include getters and setters, though in Rust, the design of setters can vary widely based on the specific needs and safety concerns of the application. For example, setters might include additional logic to validate the new value before applying it, ensuring that the state of the object remains consistent and valid. This encapsulation of validation logic within setters not only protects the data but also centralizes the enforcement of business rules or invariants, making the code easier to maintain and reason about.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to getters and setters, Rust also commonly employs constructor methods, typically called <code>new</code>, to encapsulate the creation and initialization of instances. These constructors often take the form of associated functions that return an instance of the struct, ensuring that all necessary setup and validation are performed before the object is used. By using constructors, developers can enforce rules such as mandatory fields or initial conditions, thereby preventing the creation of objects in an invalid state. Constructors can also be used to implement patterns like the builder pattern, which allows for more flexible and descriptive object creation, particularly when dealing with types that have many optional parameters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another common pattern in Rust is the use of builder structs or factory functions to construct instances of more complex types. These builders can provide a more ergonomic and fluent interface for setting up an object, especially when there are multiple optional configurations. By encapsulating the construction process, builders can enforce invariants and validate configurations, ensuring that only valid objects are created. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex initialization logic or when creating objects that require multiple steps or dependencies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, encapsulation in Rust is not limited to data fields but also extends to the encapsulation of behaviors and state transitions. This is often achieved through the use of traits, which define a set of methods that a type must implement. Traits can be used to expose only a subset of a type's functionality, further controlling how external code can interact with the type. For instance, a trait might expose only read-only methods, while more powerful methods remain private or internal to the module. This selective exposure of methods can be an effective way to guide the use of a type and prevent misuse or unintended side effects.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation is also critical for managing mutability and immutability in Rust. By default, methods that do not require mutable access to the internal state can be designed as immutable, ensuring that they do not alter the object. This distinction is enforced by the Rust compiler, which can help prevent accidental changes to an object's state. For cases where mutation is necessary, methods can be carefully designed to require mutable access, making the need for state changes explicit and controlled. This separation between mutable and immutable methods aligns with Rust's broader focus on safety and predictability, helping developers reason about how and when an object might change.
</p>

### 19.3.1. Private Fields and Public Methods
<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the core aspects of encapsulation in object-oriented programming is the ability to hide an object's internal state and require all interaction to be performed through methods. This pattern is fully supported in Rust, even though it is not an object-oriented language in the traditional sense.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, struct fields are private by default. This means they can only be accessed directly within the module in which the struct is defined. To allow controlled access to these fields, Rust developers typically define public methods on the struct. These methods can validate inputs, maintain invariants, and provide a safe, controlled interface to the data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is an example of a struct with private fields and public methods:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub struct Account {
    username: String,
    balance: i32,
}

impl Account {
    // Constructor method
    pub fn new(username: String) -> Self {
        Account { username, balance: 0 }
    }

    // Public method to get the balance
    pub fn balance(&self) -> i32 {
        self.balance
    }

    // Public method to add funds
    pub fn deposit(&mut self, amount: i32) {
        if amount > 0 {
            self.balance += amount;
        }
    }

    // Public method to withdraw funds, ensuring the balance does not go negative
    pub fn withdraw(&mut self, amount: i32) -> bool {
        if amount <= self.balance {
            self.balance -= amount;
            true
        } else {
            false
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut user_account = Account::new("Alice".to_string());
    user_account.deposit(100);
    assert_eq!(user_account.balance(), 100);
    let success = user_account.withdraw(30);
    assert!(success);
    assert_eq!(user_account.balance(), 70);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Account</code> struct encapsulates the <code>username</code> and <code>balance</code> fields, exposing them only through methods that ensure the <code>balance</code> cannot become negative.
</p>

### 19.3.2. Constructor Patterns
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The constructor pattern in Rust typically involves defining one or more associated functions that construct an instance of a struct. These are often named <code>new</code> but can have any name. The purpose of a constructor is to return a new instance of a struct, potentially after performing some validation or initialization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's a look at a typical constructor pattern:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // A constructor that ensures the rectangle always has non-zero dimensions
    pub fn new(width: u32, height: u32) -> Self {
        assert!(width > 0 && height > 0, "Dimensions must be greater than zero.");
        Rectangle { width, height }
    }

    // A method to calculate the area of the rectangle
    pub fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle::new(30, 50);
    println!("The area of the rectangle is {}", rect.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This constructor ensures that every <code>Rectangle</code> instance starts with valid dimensions, leveraging Rust's powerful compile-time checks to enforce class invariants.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Through these patterns, Rust allows developers to build safe, reliable software by controlling access to the internal state of types and ensuring that all interactions follow the specified rules and constraints. This approach not only secures the data integrity but also enhances code maintainability and readability.
</p>

## 19.4. Encapsulation in Enums
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation is a versatile concept that applies not only to structs but also to enums, offering a robust mechanism for managing data and behavior across different states. Enums in Rust are commonly recognized for defining types with a limited set of possible values, but their capabilities extend far beyond simple enumerations. They can encapsulate both data and functionality, providing a powerful tool for modeling complex systems while preserving the integrity of each distinct state.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Enums in Rust can represent various forms of state by associating different types of data with each variant. This ability allows enums to encapsulate not just the choice of a particular variant but also the data specific to that variant. For example, an enum might have different variants for handling various types of user input or processing different kinds of events. Each variant can hold data relevant to its state, such as user credentials, error messages, or configuration parameters. By doing so, enums effectively encapsulate all the necessary information and logic related to each variant, ensuring that the data remains consistent and protected.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The encapsulation provided by enums is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the different states they represent. Each variant of an enum can be designed to enforce specific rules or invariants related to its state, helping to prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being created. For instance, if an enum represents the different stages of a process, such as initialization, processing, and completion, each variant can be equipped with methods that operate only when the enum is in the appropriate state. This ensures that state transitions and operations are controlled and predictable, reducing the risk of errors and unintended behavior.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Enums can also encapsulate functionality through methods defined on the enum itself. These methods can be used to implement behaviors that are specific to each variant, allowing the enum to provide a cohesive interface for interacting with its different states. For example, an enum representing a network request might have methods for handling different types of responses or errors, with each method tailored to the needs of the specific variant. This encapsulation of functionality ensures that operations are handled in a context-aware manner, consistent with the current state of the enum.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, enums can leverage pattern matching, a powerful feature in Rust, to interact with and manage the various states encapsulated within the enum. Pattern matching allows developers to destructure and handle each variant explicitly, providing a way to work with the data and functionality associated with each state. This explicit handling ensures that all possible states are considered and managed, enhancing the reliability and correctness of the code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The use of enums for encapsulation also facilitates the implementation of state machines and other advanced design patterns. By defining an enum with variants representing different states or transitions, developers can create a clear and manageable representation of complex stateful behavior. This approach not only helps organize the code but also enforces constraints and transitions between states, leading to more predictable and maintainable systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition, enums in Rust are often used in conjunction with other encapsulation techniques, such as traits and associated methods, to build more sophisticated abstractions. Traits can be implemented for enums to provide additional functionality or to define shared behavior across different variants. This combination of enums and traits allows for flexible and modular design, where enums can encapsulate various forms of state and behavior, while traits enable reusable and extensible functionality.
</p>

### 19.4.1. Using Enums to Protect State
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Enums are particularly useful for managing state in a way that ensures only valid state transitions can occur and invalid states cannot even be represented. This pattern is commonly used in state machines, where each state has certain rules and associated data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how enums can be used to encapsulate and protect state:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub enum ConnectionState {
    Disconnected,
    Connecting { retries: u32 },
    Connected { session_id: String },
    Error { message: String },
}

impl ConnectionState {
    // A method to initiate a connection
    pub fn connect(&mut self) {
        match self {
            ConnectionState::Disconnected => {
                *self = ConnectionState::Connecting { retries: 1 };
            }
            ConnectionState::Connecting { retries } => {
                if *retries < 3 {
                    println!("Attempt {} to connect...", retries);
                    *retries += 1;
                } else {
                    *self = ConnectionState::Error {
                        message: "Failed to connect after 3 attempts.".to_string(),
                    };
                }
            }
            _ => (),
        }
    }

    // A method to establish a connection
    pub fn establish(&mut self, session_id: String) {
        if let ConnectionState::Connecting { retries: _ } = self {
            *self = ConnectionState::Connected { session_id };
        }
    }

    // A method to disconnect
    pub fn disconnect(&mut self) {
        *self = ConnectionState::Disconnected;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut connection = ConnectionState::Disconnected;
    connection.connect();
    connection.connect();
    connection.establish("session123".to_string());
    match connection {
        ConnectionState::Connected { session_id } => println!("Connected with session: {}", session_id),
        _ => println!("Failed to connect."),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>ConnectionState</code> enum encapsulates different states of a network connection. Methods like <code>connect</code> and <code>establish</code> manipulate the internal state safely, transitioning only between valid states and preventing any invalid state combinations.
</p>

### 19.4.2. Privacy Considerations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
While enums can encapsulate state effectively, it's also important to consider the visibility of each enum variant and associated data. Rust allows each variant of an enum to be declared as public or private, providing fine-grained control over who can see or modify the state.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's how privacy can be managed within enums:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod network {
    pub enum ConnectionStatus {
        Connected,
        Disconnected,
        Unknown,
    }

    impl ConnectionStatus {
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            ConnectionStatus::Unknown
        }

        pub fn set_connected(&mut self) {
            *self = ConnectionStatus::Connected;
        }

        fn set_disconnected(&mut self) {
            *self = ConnectionStatus::Disconnected;
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut status = network::ConnectionStatus::new();
    status.set_connected();
    // status.set_disconnected(); // This will fail as `set_disconnected` is private
    match status {
        network::ConnectionStatus::Connected => println!("Status: Connected"),
        network::ConnectionStatus::Disconnected => println!("Status: Disconnected"),
        network::ConnectionStatus::Unknown => println!("Status: Unknown"),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this scenario, the <code>set_disconnected</code> method is private and cannot be accessed outside of its module, ensuring that only authorized parts of the program can change the connection status to <code>Disconnected</code>. This level of control is crucial in larger systems where state changes need to be managed carefully to avoid bugs or security issues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Through these methods, enums not only help in creating expressive types but also in safeguarding the system's integrity by encapsulating and protecting the state within controlled transitions and visibility settings. This makes enums a powerful tool in the Rust developerâ€™s toolkit for building robust and secure applications.
</p>

## 19.5. Methods and Encapsulation
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming, designed to safeguard the integrity of data structures and obscure their internal workings from external access. In Rust, this principle is rigorously applied to ensure that data structures remain in valid states and that their implementation details are shielded from unintended interactions. Methods in Rust are central to this encapsulation, providing a means to bundle behavior with the data they operate on, thereby reinforcing the integrity and consistency of the program's state.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, encapsulation is achieved through a combination of private and public visibility, with methods playing a critical role in defining how data is accessed and manipulated. By default, all fields and methods within a struct or enum are private, meaning they are only accessible within the module where they are defined. This privacy ensures that the internal state and implementation details of a data structure are not exposed to external code, reducing the risk of unintended modifications and preserving the invariants of the data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Methods are functions defined within the context of a struct or enum and are used to operate on the data encapsulated by these types. They serve as the primary interface for interacting with the data, allowing external code to perform operations and retrieve information without directly accessing the underlying fields. This separation of concerns helps maintain control over how the data is accessed and modified, ensuring that the data structure remains in a valid state and that any invariants or constraints are enforced.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The role of methods in encapsulation goes beyond simply accessing or modifying data; they also encapsulate the logic and rules associated with the data. By placing logic within methods, developers can enforce constraints and validation rules that are specific to the data structure's requirements. For example, methods can include checks to ensure that values being set adhere to certain conditions, thereby preventing the creation of invalid or inconsistent states. This encapsulation of logic within methods not only protects the integrity of the data but also centralizes the implementation of business rules, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's emphasis on encapsulation through methods also extends to the use of traits. Traits define a set of methods that types can implement, providing a way to encapsulate behavior across different types. Traits enable polymorphism by allowing different types to provide their own implementations of the methods defined by the trait. This approach allows for the creation of flexible and reusable code, where behavior can be shared across types while still maintaining encapsulation and control over how the data is managed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to defining behavior, methods in Rust can also manage access to the data through the use of accessors and mutators. Accessors (often referred to as getters) provide read-only access to private fields, while mutators (or setters) allow for controlled modification of the data. By using these methods, developers can ensure that data is accessed and updated in a controlled manner, adhering to any rules or constraints imposed by the data structure. This control is crucial for maintaining the consistency and validity of the data throughout the lifecycle of the object.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, methods play a role in encapsulating complex interactions and workflows. They can orchestrate multiple operations on the data, manage state transitions, and coordinate interactions between different components. This encapsulation of functionality ensures that the data structure's behavior is managed in a cohesive and predictable manner, making it easier to reason about and maintain the code.
</p>

### 19.5.1. Getter and Setter Methods
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Getters and setters are conventional methods that provide controlled access to the fields of a struct. In Rust, where fields are private by default, getters and setters are essential for accessing and modifying these fields safely.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating the use of getters and setters in a Rust struct:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub struct Account {
    balance: f32,
}

impl Account {
    // Constructor to initialize Account
    pub fn new(initial_balance: f32) -> Self {
        Self { balance: initial_balance }
    }

    // Getter method for balance
    pub fn balance(&self) -> f32 {
        self.balance
    }

    // Setter method for balance that ensures the balance never goes negative
    pub fn set_balance(&mut self, amount: f32) {
        if amount >= 0.0 {
            self.balance = amount;
        } else {
            eprintln!("Error: Balance cannot be negative.");
        }
    }

    // A method to deposit money
    pub fn deposit(&mut self, amount: f32) {
        if amount > 0.0 {
            self.balance += amount;
        } else {
            eprintln!("Error: Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
    }

    // A method to withdraw money ensuring the balance does not go negative
    pub fn withdraw(&mut self, amount: f32) {
        if amount > 0.0 && self.balance >= amount {
            self.balance -= amount;
        } else {
            eprintln!("Error: Insufficient balance or invalid withdrawal amount.");
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut my_account = Account::new(100.0);
    println!("Initial balance: {}", my_account.balance());

    my_account.deposit(50.0);
    println!("Balance after deposit: {}", my_account.balance());

    my_account.withdraw(30.0);
    println!("Balance after withdrawal: {}", my_account.balance());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Account</code> struct has a private field <code>balance</code> that is accessed and modified through public methods. This ensures that the balance cannot be directly set to a negative number, which could violate business rules.
</p>

### 19.5.2. Encapsulating Logic in Methods
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulating logic within methods not only hides complexity but also makes the code more maintainable and secure. Methods allow us to encapsulate and control how internal states are modified and interacted with, thus adhering to the principles of encapsulation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider an example with a <code>Temperature</code> struct that encapsulates the logic for temperature conversion:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub struct Temperature {
    celsius: f32,
}

impl Temperature {
    // Constructor to initialize the Temperature
    pub fn from_celsius(celsius: f32) -> Self {
        Self { celsius }
    }

    // Method to convert celsius to fahrenheit
    pub fn to_fahrenheit(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.celsius * 1.8) + 32.0
    }

    // Method to update the temperature in celsius
    pub fn set_celsius(&mut self, celsius: f32) {
        self.celsius = celsius;
    }

    // Method to update the temperature in fahrenheit
    pub fn set_fahrenheit(&mut self, fahrenheit: f32) {
        self.celsius = (fahrenheit - 32.0) / 1.8;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut weather = Temperature::from_celsius(25.0);
    println!("Temperature in Fahrenheit: {}", weather.to_fahrenheit());

    weather.set_fahrenheit(86.0);
    println!("Temperature in Celsius after update: {}", weather.celsius);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case, the <code>Temperature</code> struct encapsulates the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Methods <code>to_fahrenheit</code>, <code>set_celsius</code>, and <code>set_fahrenheit</code> ensure that temperature conversions and updates are carried out accurately, safeguarding the integrity of the data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By encapsulating logic in methods, Rust allows developers to manage complexity safely and effectively, providing clear interfaces for interaction while maintaining the integrity and validity of the internal state of objects.
</p>

## 19.6. Traits and Interface Encapsulation
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traits are a sophisticated feature designed to define and enforce interfaces in a flexible and abstract manner, playing a critical role in encapsulating shared behavior while managing data privacy. Traits provide a mechanism for specifying a common set of methods and behaviors that different types can implement, facilitating code reuse and polymorphism. By leveraging traits, developers can create abstract interfaces that define how various types should interact with each other, all while maintaining control over how data is accessed and manipulated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traits encapsulate interfaces by specifying a collection of methods that types must implement. These methods define the operations that can be performed on the types implementing the trait, providing a consistent and predictable interface for interacting with those types. This abstraction allows developers to write generic code that can operate on any type that implements the trait, without needing to know the specific details of the type's implementation. For instance, a trait might define methods for basic arithmetic operations, and any type implementing this trait would be required to provide its own implementations for those methods. This ensures that the type adheres to the expected behavior while allowing for a wide range of implementations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The encapsulation provided by traits is particularly powerful because it allows for the separation of an interface from its implementation. Traits define what methods are available and what behavior is expected, but they do not dictate how those methods are implemented. This separation allows for a high degree of flexibility and modularity in code design. Developers can define a trait once and implement it for various types, each implementation tailored to the specific needs of the type. This approach promotes code reuse and helps maintain a clear and organized codebase.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to defining interfaces, traits also play a significant role in managing data privacy. By using traits, developers can expose only the methods that are relevant to the trait's interface, keeping other details and internal data private. This encapsulation of implementation details ensures that the internal state of a type is protected from external access and modification, thus preserving the integrity of the data. For example, a trait might define a method for accessing data in a controlled manner, while the actual data fields remain private within the type. This approach prevents direct manipulation of the internal state and enforces the use of predefined methods to interact with the data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traits also support the implementation of default methods, which provide a way to define shared behavior directly within the trait. Default methods allow for common functionality to be provided at the trait level, reducing the need for repetitive code across different type implementations. Types that implement the trait can use these default methods or override them with their own implementations if needed. This feature enhances the encapsulation of behavior by centralizing common functionality within the trait while still allowing for customization and extension.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, traits can be used to define complex interactions between types through trait bounds and associated types. Trait bounds specify that a type must implement a particular trait in order to be used with a generic function or struct, ensuring that the type provides the required methods and behavior. Associated types, on the other hand, allow traits to define placeholders for types that can be specified by the implementing type. This mechanism provides a way to work with types in a more abstract and flexible manner, further encapsulating the details of type interactions.
</p>

### 19.6.1. Defining Public Interfaces with Traits
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traits in Rust serve as a means to define public interfaces. By specifying a set of methods that a type must implement, traits allow different types to share the same interface. This is particularly useful for encapsulating and exposing only the necessary functionalities of a type, ensuring that the internal implementation details remain hidden.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's an example demonstrating how traits can be used to define a public interface:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub trait Drawable {
    fn draw(&self);
}

pub struct Circle {
    radius: f32,
}

impl Drawable for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle with radius: {}", self.radius);
    }
}

pub struct Square {
    side: f32,
}

impl Drawable for Square {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a square with side: {}", self.side);
    }
}

fn render_scene(objects: &[&dyn Drawable]) {
    for obj in objects {
        obj.draw();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
    let square = Square { side: 3.0 };

    let scene = vec![&circle as &dyn Drawable, &square as &dyn Drawable];
    render_scene(&scene);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Drawable</code> trait defines a public interface for drawing objects. Both <code>Circle</code> and <code>Square</code> implement this trait, enabling them to be used interchangeably in the <code>render_scene</code> function. This abstraction allows for flexibility and decoupling of the specifics of each drawable object from the rendering logic.
</p>

### 19.6.2. Trait Objects and Data Privacy
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Trait objects in Rust enable runtime polymorphism, which is crucial for cases where behavior needs to be abstracted across different types. A trait object can point to any instance of a type that implements the trait, encapsulating the instance behind a trait interface. This mechanism ensures that only the methods defined in the trait are accessible, thereby maintaining data privacy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's an example illustrating the use of trait objects to enforce data privacy:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub trait Encrypt {
    fn encrypt(&self, message: &str) -> String;
}

pub struct SimpleEncryptor {
    key: String,
}

impl Encrypt for SimpleEncryptor {
    fn encrypt(&self, message: &str) -> String {
        let mut encrypted = String::new();
        for char in message.chars() {
            // A simple shift cipher for illustration
            let encrypted_char = std::char::from_u32((char as u32) + 3).unwrap_or(char);
            encrypted.push(encrypted_char);
        }
        encrypted
    }
}

fn encrypt_message(encryptor: &dyn Encrypt, message: &str) -> String {
    encryptor.encrypt(message)
}

fn main() {
    let encryptor = SimpleEncryptor { key: "secret".to_string() };
    let message = "Hello, World!";
    let encrypted_message = encrypt_message(&encryptor, message);
    println!("Encrypted message: {}", encrypted_message);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Encrypt</code> trait defines an <code>encrypt</code> method, which is the only operation allowed on any <code>Encrypt</code> trait object. The <code>SimpleEncryptor</code>'s internal state (<code>key</code>) is not exposed to the clients of the <code>Encrypt</code> trait, ensuring that data privacy is maintained.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By combining traits and trait objects, Rust provides a robust mechanism to encapsulate functionality and protect sensitive data, adhering strictly to the principles of encapsulation. This approach not only secures the application but also enhances its modularity and maintainability.
</p>

## 19.7. Best Practices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The encapsulation principle is central not only to the design of robust systems but also in ensuring that libraries are easy to use, understand, and maintain. In this section, we delve into the best practices of applying encapsulation in library design and discuss common pitfalls in Rust programming, offering guidance on how to avoid them.
</p>

### 19.7.1. Encapsulation in Library Design
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation in library design is about exposing just enough for the library users to perform necessary tasks while hiding the implementation details. This approach reduces the library's complexity for the end user, increases robustness, and makes the library easier to maintain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a Rust library that provides geometric operations. The library should expose public interfaces for necessary operations while keeping the internal data and helper functions private.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub mod geometry {
    pub struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }

    impl Rectangle {
        pub fn new(width: u32, height: u32) -> Rectangle {
            Rectangle { width, height }
        }

        pub fn area(&self) -> u32 {
            self.width * self.height
        }
    }

    fn calculate_diagonal(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> f64 {
        ((rectangle.width.pow(2) + rectangle.height.pow(2)) as f64).sqrt()
    }

    pub fn diagonal_of_rectangle(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> f64 {
        calculate_diagonal(rectangle)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = geometry::Rectangle::new(10, 20);
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
    println!("Diagonal: {}", geometry::diagonal_of_rectangle(&rect));
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Rectangle</code> struct's fields are private, which means they can't be accessed or modified directly from outside the <code>geometry</code> module. This design choice encapsulates and protects the internal state of the <code>Rectangle</code>, ensuring that all instances remain valid and consistent.
</p>

### 19.7.2. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
<p style="text-align: justify;">
One common pitfall in Rust, especially for those coming from other programming languages, is misunderstanding Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing rules, which can lead to issues like trying to modify immutable data or using values after they've moved.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate a common mistake and how to correct it:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
pub struct DataHolder {
    data: Vec<i32>,
}

impl DataHolder {
    pub fn new() -> DataHolder {
        DataHolder { data: vec![1, 2, 3] }
    }

    pub fn add_data(&mut self, value: i32) {
        self.data.push(value);
    }

    pub fn data(&self) -> &[i32] {
        &self.data
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut holder = DataHolder::new();
    holder.add_data(4);
    println!("Data: {:?}", holder.data());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The potential issue here is not properly using the <code>&mut self</code> in the <code>add_data</code> method, which could lead to errors if attempted with an immutable reference. Ensuring proper use of mutable and immutable references helps maintain safe access to structured data and avoids runtime panics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By emphasizing clear interfaces, minimizing exposed data, and leveraging Rust's strong type and ownership systems, library developers can create maintainable, efficient, and robust libraries. Avoiding common pitfalls requires a solid understanding of Rust's core principles, particularly ownership, scope, and borrowing. Understanding these will allow developers to leverage Rustâ€™s powerful features to build safe and efficient applications.
</p>

## 19.8. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation is a powerful principle that, when effectively applied in Rust, can greatly enhance the safety, clarity, and maintainability of your code. By following these advices derived from practices in C++, you can leverage Rustâ€™s features to manage complexity, safeguard data integrity, and ensure that your code remains robust and adaptable.
</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Modules to Organize Code:</strong> Just as C++ uses classes to bundle data and methods, Rust uses modules to group related functionality. Utilize Rustâ€™s module system to encapsulate related structs, enums, and functions, ensuring that internal details are kept private and only exposing what is necessary through public interfaces.</p>
2. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prefer Private Fields with Public Methods:</strong> Similar to how C++ encourages private data members with public accessors, Rust developers should define struct fields as private and provide public methods for accessing and modifying them. This practice enforces encapsulation by controlling how the data is accessed and ensuring that any changes adhere to the invariants defined by the methods.</p>
3. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leverage Traits for Abstract Interfaces:</strong> Traits in Rust allow for defining abstract interfaces, much like abstract base classes in C++. Use traits to specify shared behaviors and methods across different types while keeping the implementation details hidden. This approach promotes code reuse and modularity.</p>
4. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employ Getter and Setter Methods Wisely:</strong> While Rust doesnâ€™t have a built-in mechanism for getter and setter methods, you can define methods in structs to achieve similar functionality. Use these methods to control access to private fields and to enforce any necessary constraints or validation rules, ensuring that the data remains consistent and valid.</p>
5. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encapsulate Complex Logic Within Methods:</strong> Encapsulation in Rust should also involve bundling complex logic within methods rather than exposing it directly. This helps in managing complexity, as all interactions with the data are controlled through well-defined methods, reducing the likelihood of misuse or error.</p>
6. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Associated Functions for Constructors:</strong> To create and initialize structs or enums, use associated functions. This approach encapsulates the creation logic and ensures that instances of your types are always initialized in a valid state, similar to how factory methods are used in C++.</p>
7. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employ Enums to Encapsulate State and Behavior:</strong> Rust enums are powerful tools for encapsulating different states and associated behavior. Use enums to represent various states or modes of operation and encapsulate related data and methods within each variant. This approach ensures that the data is only manipulated in contextually appropriate ways.</p>
8. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encapsulate Data in Traits for Extensibility:</strong> Use traits to define shared behaviors that types can implement. This approach encapsulates the implementation details and allows for the extension of types with new functionalities without modifying existing code, similar to how C++ interfaces allow for extensibility.</p>
9. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Control Visibility with Access Modifiers:</strong> Rustâ€™s access control system allows you to manage visibility using the <code>pub</code> keyword. Be judicious in exposing public APIs; only make necessary components public and keep implementation details private to prevent unintended interactions and maintain control over how your data is accessed and modified.</p>
10. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Document and Test Encapsulated Code:</strong> Ensure that your encapsulated code is well-documented and thoroughly tested. Provide clear documentation for public methods and traits, and write tests to verify that your encapsulation strategy correctly enforces invariants and behaves as expected. This practice enhances maintainability and helps catch issues early.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Embrace Rustâ€™s module system, traits, and methods to encapsulate data and behavior thoughtfully, and youâ€™ll build systems that are both secure and resilient.
