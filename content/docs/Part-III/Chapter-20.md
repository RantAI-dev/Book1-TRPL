## 20.1. Overview of Composition and Inheritance
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition and inheritance are core concepts in software design, used to manage and extend the functionality of types. Composition involves building complex types by combining simpler, reusable components. It uses a "has-a" relationship, where a type contains other types to achieve its desired functionality. Structs and traits are the primary constructs used for composition. Structs create complex data types with multiple fields, while traits define shared behavior that different types can implement. This modular approach enhances flexibility and code reuse, allowing new types to be composed of existing ones without modification.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a scenario where we need to model an application with various shapes. Composition can be used to combine traits to define shared behaviors. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a trait for drawing
trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}

// Define a struct for a circle
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

// Implement the Draw trait for Circle
impl Draw for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle with radius: {}", self.radius);
    }
}

// Define a struct for a rectangle
struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

// Implement the Draw trait for Rectangle
impl Draw for Rectangle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a rectangle with width: {} and height: {}", self.width, self.height);
    }
}

// Use composition to create a struct that contains different shapes
struct DrawingApp {
    shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}

impl DrawingApp {
    fn new() -> Self {
        DrawingApp {
            shapes: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add_shape(&mut self, shape: Box<dyn Draw>) {
        self.shapes.push(shape);
    }

    fn draw_all(&self) {
        for shape in &self.shapes {
            shape.draw();
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut app = DrawingApp::new();

    app.add_shape(Box::new(Circle { radius: 10.0 }));
    app.add_shape(Box::new(Rectangle { width: 20.0, height: 15.0 }));

    app.draw_all();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Draw</code> trait defines a common behavior for drawing shapes. The <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code> structs implement this trait, while the <code>DrawingApp</code> struct uses composition to manage a collection of shapes. By using a <code>Vec<Box<dyn Draw>></code>, <code>DrawingApp</code> can handle different types of shapes interchangeably, demonstrating how composition fosters flexibility and reusability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance, on the other hand, involves extending existing types to create new types with additional functionality, using an "is-a" relationship where a derived type inherits properties and methods from a base type. This model is prevalent in many object-oriented languages but often leads to deep hierarchies and tight coupling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Instead of strict inheritance hierarchies, traits in Rust provide a way to achieve polymorphism and code reuse. Traits define shared functionality that various types can implement, avoiding the rigidity of traditional inheritance models and promoting a more modular and maintainable approach to design.
</p>

## 20.2. Key Differences in Rust vs Other Languages
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When examining the use of composition and inheritance across different programming languages, Rust introduces unique features and paradigms that distinguish it from traditional object-oriented languages like C++ or Java. The primary differences lie in Rustâ€™s approach to type composition, memory management, and safety guarantees.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In traditional object-oriented languages, inheritance is often used to create a hierarchy of classes. This hierarchy establishes "is-a" relationships, where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass. This approach can lead to deep inheritance trees and tight coupling between classes. For example, in Java:
</p>

{{< prism lang="java" line-numbers="true">}}
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited behavior
        dog.bark(); // Dog-specific behavior
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Dog</code> inherits from <code>Animal</code>, gaining its <code>eat</code> method while adding its own <code>bark</code> method. This inheritance model works well for defining hierarchical relationships but can lead to issues with flexibility and code maintainability as the hierarchy deepens.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust, however, does not use traditional inheritance. Instead, Rust employs composition via traits and structs, fostering a different approach to code organization and reuse. Rustâ€™s traits provide a way to define shared behavior without imposing a hierarchical relationship. Traits in Rust allow you to specify methods that can be implemented by multiple types, achieving polymorphism without inheritance. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a trait for behavior
trait Animal {
    fn eat(&self);
}

// Implement the trait for a struct
struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("The dog eats food.");
    }
}

// Struct with additional behavior
struct DogWithBark;

impl Animal for DogWithBark {
    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("The dog with bark eats food.");
    }
}

impl DogWithBark {
    fn bark(&self) {
        println!("The dog barks.");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    dog.eat(); // Behavior defined in trait

    let dog_with_bark = DogWithBark;
    dog_with_bark.eat(); // Behavior defined in trait
    dog_with_bark.bark(); // Additional behavior
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust example, the <code>Animal</code> trait defines a common behavior for <code>Dog</code> and <code>DogWithBark</code>. Both structs implement the <code>Animal</code> trait but add additional methods specific to their own needs. This approach promotes flexibility, as traits can be implemented for any type, and types can implement multiple traits, thereby combining functionalities without deep inheritance hierarchies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another key difference is Rust's emphasis on ownership and borrowing. Unlike many object-oriented languages where memory management is handled by garbage collection or manual allocation/deallocation, Rust enforces memory safety through its ownership system. This system ensures that there are no data races or null pointer dereferences by enforcing strict rules at compile time. This is different from languages like C++ or Java, where developers must handle or rely on runtime checks for such issues. For example, Rust's ownership model guarantees that references are either mutable or immutable but not both simultaneously:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let y = &x; // Immutable borrow
    let z = &x; // Another immutable borrow

    // let w = &mut x; // Error: cannot borrow `x` as mutable because it is already borrowed as immutable

    println!("y: {}, z: {}", y, z);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code snippet, Rustâ€™s compiler prevents mutable and immutable borrows from occurring simultaneously, which would otherwise lead to potential data races or undefined behavior in other languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s approach to composition and its emphasis on ownership and borrowing provide a robust framework for managing type relationships and memory safety. While traditional object-oriented languages rely on inheritance to create hierarchical relationships, Rust favors composition and traits, allowing for more flexible and safe code structures. This fundamental difference underscores Rustâ€™s focus on performance and safety, setting it apart from languages with more traditional inheritance-based designs.
</p>

## 20.3. Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class. This relationship is typically described as an "is-a" relationship, where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, enabling a subclass to utilize and extend the functionalities of a superclass.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In languages like Java or C++, inheritance is implemented using keywords such as <code>extends</code> or <code>:</code>, respectively. For example, in Java, you might define a superclass <code>Animal</code> and a subclass <code>Dog</code> as follows:
</p>

{{< prism lang="java" line-numbers="true">}}
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Dog</code> class inherits the <code>eat</code> method from the <code>Animal</code> class while adding its own <code>bark</code> method. This illustrates how inheritance allows a subclass to reuse and extend the behavior of its superclass, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, inheritance also has its downsides. Deep inheritance hierarchies can lead to tightly coupled code, where changes in the superclass can have widespread effects on all subclasses. This can make the codebase difficult to maintain and understand. Additionally, multiple inheritance (where a class inherits from more than one superclass) can introduce complexity and ambiguity, as seen in C++, which allows multiple inheritance but must resolve potential conflicts between inherited properties or methods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust does not support traditional class-based inheritance. Instead, Rust encourages the use of composition and traits to achieve code reuse and polymorphism. Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in Java; they define a set of methods that types can implement. For example, consider the following Rust code that defines an <code>Animal</code> trait and implements it for a <code>Dog</code> struct:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a trait for shared behavior
trait Animal {
    fn eat(&self);
}

// Implement the trait for a struct
struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("The dog eats food.");
    }
}

impl Dog {
    fn bark(&self) {
        println!("The dog barks.");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    dog.eat(); // Behavior defined by the Animal trait
    dog.bark(); // Additional behavior specific to Dog
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust example, the <code>Animal</code> trait defines the <code>eat</code> method, which is implemented by the <code>Dog</code> struct. The <code>Dog</code> struct also has its own <code>bark</code> method. This approach achieves similar goals to inheritance by allowing different types to share common behavior (defined by traits) while also enabling specific types to have their unique behaviors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By favoring traits and composition over inheritance, Rust avoids the pitfalls of deep inheritance hierarchies and tightly coupled code. Traits provide a way to define shared behavior that can be implemented by multiple types, promoting code reuse and flexibility without the need for a rigid class hierarchy. Composition allows complex types to be built from simpler, reusable components, further enhancing modularity and maintainability.
</p>

### 20.3.1. Examples in C++ and Java
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In traditional object-oriented languages like C++ and Java, inheritance is a key mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This facilitates code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class structures. In these languages, inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between the superclass (parent class) and the subclass (child class).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In C++, inheritance is implemented using the <code>:</code> symbol followed by the access specifier (public, protected, or private) and the name of the superclass. For example, consider a simple hierarchy where <code>Animal</code> is the superclass and <code>Dog</code> is the subclass:
</p>

{{< prism lang="cpp" line-numbers="true">}}
#include <iostream>

// Superclass
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        std::cout << "This animal eats food." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Subclass
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        std::cout << "The dog barks." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog;
    dog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
    dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    return 0;
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this C++ example, the <code>Dog</code> class inherits from the <code>Animal</code> class. This means that <code>Dog</code> objects have access to the <code>eat</code> method defined in <code>Animal</code>, as well as the <code>bark</code> method defined in <code>Dog</code>. This demonstrates how inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing the <code>Dog</code> class to use functionality defined in the <code>Animal</code> class without having to redefine it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Java, the syntax for inheritance is similar, using the <code>extends</code> keyword. Here is an equivalent example in Java:
</p>

{{< prism lang="java" line-numbers="true">}}
// Superclass
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Java example, the <code>Dog</code> class extends the <code>Animal</code> class, inheriting the <code>eat</code> method while also defining its own <code>bark</code> method. This setup allows the <code>Dog</code> class to utilize and extend the functionality of the <code>Animal</code> class, demonstrating inheritance's ability to promote code reuse and the extension of existing functionality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance also allows for method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass. This enables polymorphism, allowing a method to behave differently based on the object that invokes it. For example, consider the following Java code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="java" line-numbers="true">}}
// Superclass
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("This animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound(); // Calls the overridden method in Dog
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Dog</code> class overrides the <code>makeSound</code> method from the <code>Animal</code> class. When the <code>makeSound</code> method is called on an <code>Animal</code> reference that actually points to a <code>Dog</code> object, the overridden method in the <code>Dog</code> class is executed. This demonstrates polymorphism, a core principle of OOP, where the same method can have different behaviors depending on the object's actual type.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, while inheritance promotes code reuse and polymorphism, it can also lead to issues such as tight coupling and difficulties in maintenance. Deep inheritance hierarchies can make the codebase complex and fragile, as changes in a superclass can have far-reaching effects on all subclasses. This is where composition, a design principle that Rust heavily relies on, offers a more flexible and modular alternative to inheritance.
</p>

### 20.3.2. Advantages and Disadvantages
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance in traditional object-oriented programming languages like C++ and Java has both advantages and disadvantages. Understanding these can help in making informed decisions about using inheritance or alternative design patterns, such as composition, especially when working in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the primary advantages of inheritance is code reuse. By creating a hierarchy where a subclass inherits from a superclass, you can avoid redundant code. For example, if multiple classes share common attributes or methods, these can be defined in a single superclass and inherited by each subclass. This promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable. For instance, in Java:
</p>

{{< prism lang="java" line-numbers="true">}}
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Dog</code> class inherits the <code>eat</code> method from the <code>Animal</code> class, allowing code reuse and avoiding duplication.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another advantage is the establishment of a clear hierarchical relationship. Inheritance models real-world relationships and can make the code more intuitive. For example, in a graphics application, you might have a <code>Shape</code> superclass with subclasses like <code>Circle</code> and <code>Square</code>. This hierarchy is natural and easy to understand:
</p>

{{< prism lang="java" line-numbers="true">}}
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square.");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Polymorphism is another significant advantage of inheritance. It allows objects to be treated as instances of their superclass rather than their actual class. This enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="java" line-numbers="true">}}
Shape shape1 = new Circle();
Shape shape2 = new Square();
shape1.draw(); // Drawing a circle.
shape2.draw(); // Drawing a square.
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, inheritance also has notable disadvantages. One major issue is tight coupling. Subclasses are tightly bound to the implementation details of their superclasses. Changes in the superclass can have unforeseen effects on all subclasses, leading to fragile code. This can make maintenance difficult and error-prone, especially in large codebases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another disadvantage is the inflexibility of inheritance. Inheritance defines a strict hierarchical relationship that can be limiting. For example, if you need a class to inherit behavior from multiple sources, traditional single inheritance can be restrictive. While languages like C++ support multiple inheritance, it can introduce complexity and ambiguity, such as the diamond problem. Java, on the other hand, does not support multiple inheritance for classes, only for interfaces, which restricts flexibility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance can also lead to an anti-pattern known as the "God Object," where a superclass becomes too bloated with functionality that is shared among various subclasses. This can make the superclass unwieldy and difficult to understand or modify. Furthermore, deep inheritance hierarchies can become complex and hard to navigate, making the code less readable and maintainable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust, by design, avoids these pitfalls by favoring composition over inheritance. In Rust, code reuse and polymorphism are achieved through traits and composition rather than class hierarchies. Traits allow you to define shared behavior that can be implemented by different types, promoting flexibility and reducing tight coupling. Hereâ€™s a simple Rust example using traits:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Animal {
    fn eat(&self);
}

struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("The dog eats.");
    }
}

struct Cat;

impl Animal for Cat {
    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("The cat eats.");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_dog = Dog;
    let my_cat = Cat;
    my_dog.eat();
    my_cat.eat();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Dog</code> and <code>Cat</code> both implement the <code>Animal</code> trait, allowing for shared behavior without a rigid hierarchy. This approach provides the benefits of code reuse and polymorphism while avoiding the downsides of traditional inheritance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By understanding the advantages and disadvantages of inheritance, developers can make better design choices, leveraging composition and traits in Rust to create more maintainable and flexible code.
</p>

## 20.4. Composition in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition in Rust is a design principle where complex types are built from simpler ones by combining their functionality. Unlike inheritance in traditional object-oriented languages, where a class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class, composition involves creating types that contain instances of other types and delegate functionality to them. This approach leads to more flexible and reusable code, as it avoids the rigidity and tight coupling associated with inheritance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, composition is achieved through the use of structs and traits. Structs define the data structure, while traits define the behavior. By implementing traits for structs, we can compose different behaviors to create more complex types. This method promotes code reuse and modularity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Let's start by defining a simple example. Consider two types, <code>Car</code> and <code>Bicycle</code>, both of which can move and make noise. We define these types and their behaviors using structs and traits.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Car;

struct Bicycle;

trait Movable {
    fn move_it(&self);
}

trait NoiseMaker {
    fn make_noise(&self);
}

impl Movable for Car {
    fn move_it(&self) {
        println!("The car is moving");
    }
}

impl NoiseMaker for Car {
    fn make_noise(&self) {
        println!("Vroom! Vroom!");
    }
}

impl Movable for Bicycle {
    fn move_it(&self) {
        println!("The bicycle is moving");
    }
}

impl NoiseMaker for Bicycle {
    fn make_noise(&self) {
        println!("Ring! Ring!");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Car</code> and <code>Bicycle</code> are structs that implement the <code>Movable</code> and <code>NoiseMaker</code> traits. Each struct provides its own implementation of the methods defined in these traits.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we can create a generic <code>Vehicle</code> struct that can hold any type that implements both the <code>Movable</code> and <code>NoiseMaker</code> traits. This demonstrates composition by delegating functionality to the contained type.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Vehicle<T: Movable + NoiseMaker> {
    component: T,
}

impl<T: Movable + NoiseMaker> Vehicle<T> {
    fn new(component: T) -> Self {
        Vehicle { component }
    }

    fn move_it(&self) {
        self.component.move_it();
    }

    fn make_noise(&self) {
        self.component.make_noise();
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>Vehicle</code> struct is a generic type that takes a parameter <code>T</code> constrained by the <code>Movable</code> and <code>NoiseMaker</code> traits. It contains an instance of <code>T</code> and provides methods to move the vehicle and make noise, delegating these actions to the contained component.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, we can create instances of <code>Vehicle</code> with <code>Car</code> and <code>Bicycle</code> components and call their methods.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let car = Vehicle::new(Car);
    car.move_it();
    car.make_noise();

    let bicycle = Vehicle::new(Bicycle);
    bicycle.move_it();
    bicycle.make_noise();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When running this code, the output will be:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
The car is moving
Vroom! Vroom!
The bicycle is moving
Ring! Ring!
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example illustrates how composition in Rust allows us to build complex types by combining simpler ones, promoting code reuse and flexibility. Instead of relying on inheritance, Rust's composition model uses traits and structs to achieve polymorphism and modularity, resulting in more maintainable and adaptable code.
</p>

### 20.4.1. How Composition Works in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition in Rust works by combining smaller, reusable components to build complex types. This approach relies on the use of structs to define data structures and traits to define behaviors. Unlike inheritance in traditional object-oriented programming, where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a superclass, composition in Rust promotes more flexible and decoupled designs. By aggregating multiple structs and implementing traits, Rust allows you to compose complex behaviors and functionalities in a modular and reusable way.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To understand how composition works in Rust, let's consider an example where we want to model different types of media players, such as an audio player and a video player. Both players should be able to play, pause, and stop, but they have different implementations for each action.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we define the traits that represent the shared behaviors:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Playable {
    fn play(&self);
}

trait Pausable {
    fn pause(&self);
}

trait Stoppable {
    fn stop(&self);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These traits define the methods that our media players will implement. Next, we define the structs for <code>AudioPlayer</code> and <code>VideoPlayer</code> and implement the traits for each struct:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct AudioPlayer;

struct VideoPlayer;

impl Playable for AudioPlayer {
    fn play(&self) {
        println!("Playing audio");
    }
}

impl Pausable for AudioPlayer {
    fn pause(&self) {
        println!("Pausing audio");
    }
}

impl Stoppable for AudioPlayer {
    fn stop(&self) {
        println!("Stopping audio");
    }
}

impl Playable for VideoPlayer {
    fn play(&self) {
        println!("Playing video");
    }
}

impl Pausable for VideoPlayer {
    fn pause(&self) {
        println!("Pausing video");
    }
}

impl Stoppable for VideoPlayer {
    fn stop(&self) {
        println!("Stopping video");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>AudioPlayer</code> and <code>VideoPlayer</code> structs each implement the <code>Playable</code>, <code>Pausable</code>, and <code>Stoppable</code> traits, providing their own specific implementations for the methods defined in these traits.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To demonstrate composition, we can create a generic <code>MediaPlayer</code> struct that can hold any type that implements the <code>Playable</code>, <code>Pausable</code>, and <code>Stoppable</code> traits. This allows us to create a media player that delegates actions to the contained component:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct MediaPlayer<T: Playable + Pausable + Stoppable> {
    component: T,
}

impl<T: Playable + Pausable + Stoppable> MediaPlayer<T> {
    fn new(component: T) -> Self {
        MediaPlayer { component }
    }

    fn play(&self) {
        self.component.play();
    }

    fn pause(&self) {
        self.component.pause();
    }

    fn stop(&self) {
        self.component.stop();
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>MediaPlayer</code> struct is a generic type that takes a parameter <code>T</code> constrained by the <code>Playable</code>, <code>Pausable</code>, and <code>Stoppable</code> traits. It contains an instance of <code>T</code> and provides methods to play, pause, and stop the media, delegating these actions to the contained component.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, we can create instances of <code>MediaPlayer</code> with <code>AudioPlayer</code> and <code>VideoPlayer</code> components and call their methods:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let audio_player = MediaPlayer::new(AudioPlayer);
    audio_player.play();
    audio_player.pause();
    audio_player.stop();

    let video_player = MediaPlayer::new(VideoPlayer);
    video_player.play();
    video_player.pause();
    video_player.stop();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When running this code, the output will be:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
Playing audio
Pausing audio
Stopping audio
Playing video
Pausing video
Stopping video
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example illustrates how composition in Rust allows you to build complex types by combining simpler ones. By using traits to define shared behaviors and structs to implement these traits, you can create modular and reusable components. The <code>MediaPlayer</code> struct demonstrates how you can aggregate different types and delegate functionality to the contained components. This approach promotes code reuse, reduces tight coupling, and enhances the flexibility and maintainability of your codebase. Rust's composition model, facilitated by traits and structs, offers a powerful and efficient way to design complex systems.
</p>

### 20.4.2. Examples of Composition in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition in Rust involves building complex functionality by combining simpler, reusable components. This approach uses structs to define data structures and traits to define behaviors. Unlike traditional inheritance-based object-oriented programming, where classes derive from each other, composition in Rust promotes a more modular and flexible design by allowing objects to be assembled from smaller parts. This results in a system where components can be easily swapped or reused without significant code changes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate composition in Rust, let's build an example involving different types of shapes. We'll define common behaviors such as calculating the area and perimeter, and then combine these shapes into a collection that can handle them uniformly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we define the traits that represent the common behaviors for shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64;
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These traits define the methods that our shapes will implement. Next, we define structs for specific shapes such as <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code> and implement the <code>Shape</code> trait for each struct:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius
    }
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        2.0 * (self.width + self.height)
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code> structs each implement the <code>Shape</code> trait, providing their own specific implementations for the methods defined in the trait. This allows us to use these shapes interchangeably wherever a <code>Shape</code> is expected.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To demonstrate composition, we can create a <code>ShapeCollection</code> struct that holds a vector of objects that implement the <code>Shape</code> trait. This allows us to work with a collection of different shapes in a uniform way:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct ShapeCollection {
    shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Shape>>,
}

impl ShapeCollection {
    fn new() -> Self {
        ShapeCollection { shapes: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_shape(&mut self, shape: Box<dyn Shape>) {
        self.shapes.push(shape);
    }

    fn total_area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.shapes.iter().map(|shape| shape.area()).sum()
    }

    fn total_perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        self.shapes.iter().map(|shape| shape.perimeter()).sum()
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>ShapeCollection</code> struct contains a vector of boxed trait objects (<code>Box<dyn Shape></code>), allowing it to store any type that implements the <code>Shape</code> trait. The <code>add_shape</code> method adds a new shape to the collection, while the <code>total_area</code> and <code>total_perimeter</code> methods calculate the total area and perimeter of all shapes in the collection, respectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, we can create instances of <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code>, add them to a <code>ShapeCollection</code>, and calculate the total area and perimeter:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut collection = ShapeCollection::new();

    let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 3.0, height: 4.0 };

    collection.add_shape(Box::new(circle));
    collection.add_shape(Box::new(rectangle));

    println!("Total Area: {:.2}", collection.total_area());
    println!("Total Perimeter: {:.2}", collection.total_perimeter());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When running this code, the output will be:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text">}}
Total Area: 90.54
Total Perimeter: 45.42
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example illustrates how composition in Rust allows you to build complex functionality by combining simpler, reusable components. By using traits to define common behaviors and structs to implement these traits, you can create a system where different types can be treated uniformly. The <code>ShapeCollection</code> struct demonstrates how you can aggregate different shapes and work with them in a consistent way. This approach promotes code reuse, reduces tight coupling, and enhances the flexibility and maintainability of your codebase. Rust's composition model, facilitated by traits and structs, provides a powerful and efficient way to design complex systems.
</p>

### 20.4.3. Implementing Composition in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition is a fundamental design principle in Rust that emphasizes building complex types from simpler, reusable components. Unlike inheritance, which creates a tight coupling between classes, composition focuses on assembling objects using other objects. In Rust, this approach is achieved through the use of structs and traits, providing a flexible and modular way to design software systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, composition is implemented primarily using structs, which are custom data types that can hold multiple values of different types. The key idea is to define a struct that contains other structs as its fields. This method allows you to create complex types by composing simpler ones, fostering code reuse and modular design.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a scenario where you are designing a system for managing different types of vehicles. Instead of creating a complex inheritance hierarchy, you can use composition to model various vehicle characteristics. For example, you might define a <code>Vehicle</code> struct that contains fields for common attributes like <code>make</code>, <code>model</code>, and <code>year</code>. Additionally, you could define other structs such as <code>Engine</code> and <code>Transmission</code>, which can be included as fields in the <code>Vehicle</code> struct.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is a sample implementation in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Engine struct
struct Engine {
    horsepower: u32,
    fuel_type: String,
}

// Define the Transmission struct
struct Transmission {
    transmission_type: String,
    number_of_gears: u32,
}

// Define the Vehicle struct with composition
struct Vehicle {
    make: String,
    model: String,
    year: u32,
    engine: Engine,
    transmission: Transmission,
}

// Implement methods for Vehicle
impl Vehicle {
    fn new(make: String, model: String, year: u32, engine: Engine, transmission: Transmission) -> Self {
        Vehicle {
            make,
            model,
            year,
            engine,
            transmission,
        }
    }

    fn display_info(&self) {
        println!("{} {} ({})", self.make, self.model, self.year);
        println!("Engine: {} HP, Fuel Type: {}", self.engine.horsepower, self.engine.fuel_type);
        println!("Transmission: {}, Gears: {}", self.transmission.transmission_type, self.transmission.number_of_gears);
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create Engine and Transmission instances
    let engine = Engine {
        horsepower: 150,
        fuel_type: "Gasoline".to_string(),
    };

    let transmission = Transmission {
        transmission_type: "Automatic".to_string(),
        number_of_gears: 6,
    };

    // Create a Vehicle instance using composition
    let car = Vehicle::new(
        "Toyota".to_string(),
        "Camry".to_string(),
        2022,
        engine,
        transmission,
    );

    // Display the information of the vehicle
    car.display_info();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Vehicle</code> is composed of <code>Engine</code> and <code>Transmission</code>. This design allows <code>Vehicle</code> to reuse the <code>Engine</code> and <code>Transmission</code> structs without creating an inheritance hierarchy. Each struct has its own responsibilities, and <code>Vehicle</code> aggregates these components to form a complete entity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition in Rust provides several advantages. First, it promotes flexibility because you can easily swap or extend components without modifying existing code. For instance, you could create different types of <code>Engine</code> or <code>Transmission</code> structs and use them with the <code>Vehicle</code> struct, allowing for a variety of configurations. This approach also enhances maintainability as changes in one component do not directly affect others.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, composition in Rust aligns with the languageâ€™s focus on safety and performance. By using structs and owning data rather than relying on inheritance, Rust ensures that ownership and borrowing principles are respected, preventing issues like dangling references and ensuring memory safety.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing composition in Rust encourages a modular and reusable design pattern, allowing you to build complex systems in a manageable and efficient way. This approach leverages Rustâ€™s strengths, including its type system and ownership model, to create robust and scalable software solutions.
</p>

## 20.5. Structs and Traits as Building Blocks
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, structs and traits serve as fundamental building blocks for creating and organizing data and behavior. They enable developers to construct complex types and define their behavior in a modular and reusable way, adhering to Rust's emphasis on safety and efficiency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Structs are custom data types that allow you to define and encapsulate data. They are analogous to classes in object-oriented languages but without inheritance. A struct in Rust consists of named fields that can hold various types of data. This structure allows you to model real-world entities or abstract concepts by grouping related data together. Structs can be used to represent anything from simple values to complex data structures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the use of structs, consider an example where you need to represent a <code>Rectangle</code> with its width and height. You define a struct <code>Rectangle</code> with fields for these dimensions. You can then create instances of <code>Rectangle</code>, access its fields, and implement methods to operate on this data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is a basic implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Rectangle struct
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

// Implement methods for Rectangle
impl Rectangle {
    // Method to calculate the area of the rectangle
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    // Method to create a new Rectangle
    fn new(width: u32, height: u32) -> Self {
        Rectangle { width, height }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create a new Rectangle instance
    let rect = Rectangle::new(30, 50);

    // Display the area of the rectangle
    println!("The area of the rectangle is {}", rect.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Rectangle</code> struct encapsulates the width and height of a rectangle. The <code>area</code> method calculates the area based on these dimensions, and the <code>new</code> method creates a new instance of <code>Rectangle</code>. This design illustrates how structs can encapsulate data and provide functionality through methods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traits, on the other hand, define shared behavior that can be implemented by different types. They are somewhat analogous to interfaces in other languages. Traits allow you to specify a set of methods that a type must implement, without providing the implementation itself. This enables polymorphism, where different types can provide their own implementations of the methods defined in the trait.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, you might define a trait <code>Shape</code> that requires implementing the <code>area</code> method. Different structs, such as <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>, can then implement this trait to provide their own versions of the <code>area</code> method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is an example of defining and implementing a trait:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Shape trait
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

// Define the Rectangle struct
struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

// Implement the Shape trait for Rectangle
impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

// Define the Circle struct
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

// Implement the Shape trait for Circle
impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create instances of Rectangle and Circle
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 30.0, height: 50.0 };
    let circle = Circle { radius: 10.0 };

    // Calculate and display the area of each shape
    println!("The area of the rectangle is {}", rect.area());
    println!("The area of the circle is {}", circle.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Shape</code> trait defines a method <code>area</code> that must be implemented by any type that implements the trait. Both <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code> structs implement the <code>Shape</code> trait, providing their own implementations of the <code>area</code> method. This allows for polymorphism, where different shapes can be treated uniformly through the <code>Shape</code> trait.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Structs and traits together form a powerful combination in Rust. Structs provide a way to group and manage data, while traits enable you to define and enforce shared behavior across different types. This approach fosters a modular and extensible design, making it easier to build and maintain complex systems. By leveraging structs and traits, Rust developers can create robust and flexible code that adheres to the principles of ownership, safety, and performance.
</p>

### 20.5.1. Delegation Pattern
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The delegation pattern is a design strategy that allows an object to delegate some of its responsibilities to another object, known as a delegate. This pattern is especially useful for promoting composition over inheritance and improving code modularity and reusability. In Rust, the delegation pattern can be effectively implemented using structs and traits, providing a flexible mechanism for managing behavior.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In essence, delegation involves creating a struct that contains another struct and forwards method calls to the contained struct. This approach allows you to extend or modify the behavior of the delegate without altering the delegatorâ€™s code. The delegator struct holds an instance of the delegate and invokes methods on this instance, effectively "delegating" specific functionality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the delegation pattern in Rust, consider a scenario where you have a <code>User</code> struct that needs to handle user authentication. Instead of implementing authentication logic directly within the <code>User</code> struct, you can create a separate <code>AuthService</code> struct that is responsible for authentication. The <code>User</code> struct then delegates authentication tasks to an instance of <code>AuthService</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is a detailed implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the AuthService struct responsible for authentication
struct AuthService {
    username: String,
    password: String,
}

impl AuthService {
    fn new(username: String, password: String) -> Self {
        AuthService { username, password }
    }

    // Method to authenticate a user
    fn authenticate(&self, username: &str, password: &str) -> bool {
        self.username == username && self.password == password
    }
}

// Define the User struct that delegates authentication to AuthService
struct User {
    name: String,
    auth_service: AuthService,
}

impl User {
    fn new(name: String, auth_service: AuthService) -> Self {
        User { name, auth_service }
    }

    // Method to authenticate a user using AuthService
    fn authenticate(&self, username: &str, password: &str) -> bool {
        self.auth_service.authenticate(username, password)
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create an instance of AuthService
    let auth_service = AuthService::new("admin".to_string(), "password123".to_string());

    // Create a User instance that delegates authentication to AuthService
    let user = User::new("Alice".to_string(), auth_service);

    // Attempt to authenticate using the User instance
    let is_authenticated = user.authenticate("admin", "password123");
    println!("Authentication successful: {}", is_authenticated);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>AuthService</code> struct handles the authentication logic. The <code>User</code> struct contains an instance of <code>AuthService</code> and delegates the authentication process to it through the <code>authenticate</code> method. This delegation approach allows you to separate concerns, keeping authentication logic encapsulated within <code>AuthService</code> and maintaining a clean interface in <code>User</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The delegation pattern in Rust promotes several benefits. It enhances code modularity by separating different responsibilities into distinct structs. This separation makes the code easier to understand and maintain. Additionally, by using delegation, you can modify or extend the behavior of the delegate without changing the delegator, fostering a more flexible and extensible design.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, Rustâ€™s ownership model ensures that delegation does not introduce issues related to ownership or borrowing, as long as you properly manage the lifetimes of the structs involved. The pattern also aligns with Rustâ€™s emphasis on composition over inheritance, enabling you to build complex systems by combining simpler, reusable components.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The delegation pattern in Rust offers a robust method for designing modular and maintainable systems. By leveraging structs and traits, you can implement delegation to achieve clear separation of concerns and promote code reuse, leading to a more organized and flexible software architecture.
</p>

### 20.5.2. Example: Building a Complex Type with Composition
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, composition is a powerful design pattern that allows you to construct complex types by combining simpler ones. This approach leverages the strength of Rustâ€™s type system and ownership model to create flexible and reusable structures. To illustrate this concept, consider an example where we build a complex type representing a <code>SmartHome</code> system. This system will consist of various components such as lights, thermostats, and security systems, each modeled as separate structs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The first step is to define the basic components of the smart home system. We will create structs for <code>Light</code>, <code>Thermostat</code>, and <code>SecuritySystem</code>. Each of these structs will encapsulate data and functionality specific to the component it represents.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For the <code>Light</code> struct, we might include fields for the state of the light (on or off) and its brightness level. The <code>Thermostat</code> struct will have fields for the current temperature and the desired temperature. Finally, the <code>SecuritySystem</code> struct will include fields to represent whether the system is armed or disarmed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is how you might define these components in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Light struct
struct Light {
    is_on: bool,
    brightness: u8,
}

impl Light {
    fn new(is_on: bool, brightness: u8) -> Self {
        Light { is_on, brightness }
    }

    fn turn_on(&mut self) {
        self.is_on = true;
    }

    fn turn_off(&mut self) {
        self.is_on = false;
    }

    fn set_brightness(&mut self, brightness: u8) {
        self.brightness = brightness;
    }
}

// Define the Thermostat struct
struct Thermostat {
    current_temperature: f64,
    desired_temperature: f64,
}

impl Thermostat {
    fn new(current_temperature: f64, desired_temperature: f64) -> Self {
        Thermostat {
            current_temperature,
            desired_temperature,
        }
    }

    fn set_temperature(&mut self, temperature: f64) {
        self.desired_temperature = temperature;
    }
}

// Define the SecuritySystem struct
struct SecuritySystem {
    is_armed: bool,
}

impl SecuritySystem {
    fn new(is_armed: bool) -> Self {
        SecuritySystem { is_armed }
    }

    fn arm(&mut self) {
        self.is_armed = true;
    }

    fn disarm(&mut self) {
        self.is_armed = false;
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
With the individual components defined, we now need to create a <code>SmartHome</code> struct that aggregates these components. The <code>SmartHome</code> struct will include instances of <code>Light</code>, <code>Thermostat</code>, and <code>SecuritySystem</code>. This design allows <code>SmartHome</code> to manage and interact with its components.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how you might define the <code>SmartHome</code> struct and implement methods to control its components:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the SmartHome struct with composition
struct SmartHome {
    lights: Light,
    thermostat: Thermostat,
    security_system: SecuritySystem,
}

impl SmartHome {
    fn new(lights: Light, thermostat: Thermostat, security_system: SecuritySystem) -> Self {
        SmartHome {
            lights,
            thermostat,
            security_system,
        }
    }

    fn turn_on_lights(&mut self) {
        self.lights.turn_on();
    }

    fn turn_off_lights(&mut self) {
        self.lights.turn_off();
    }

    fn set_light_brightness(&mut self, brightness: u8) {
        self.lights.set_brightness(brightness);
    }

    fn set_thermostat_temperature(&mut self, temperature: f64) {
        self.thermostat.set_temperature(temperature);
    }

    fn arm_security_system(&mut self) {
        self.security_system.arm();
    }

    fn disarm_security_system(&mut self) {
        self.security_system.disarm();
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this <code>SmartHome</code> struct, methods such as <code>turn_on_lights</code>, <code>set_light_brightness</code>, and <code>set_thermostat_temperature</code> demonstrate how the <code>SmartHome</code> interacts with its components. Each method delegates the task to the appropriate component, encapsulating the functionality and promoting a clean separation of concerns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is how you might use the <code>SmartHome</code> struct in a <code>main</code> function:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    // Create instances of the components
    let light = Light::new(false, 50);
    let thermostat = Thermostat::new(72.0, 68.0);
    let security_system = SecuritySystem::new(false);

    // Create an instance of SmartHome
    let mut smart_home = SmartHome::new(light, thermostat, security_system);

    // Control the smart home system
    smart_home.turn_on_lights();
    smart_home.set_light_brightness(75);
    smart_home.set_thermostat_temperature(70.0);
    smart_home.arm_security_system();

    // Output some state information
    println!("Lights are on: {}", smart_home.lights.is_on);
    println!("Thermostat is set to: {}", smart_home.thermostat.desired_temperature);
    println!("Security system is armed: {}", smart_home.security_system.is_armed);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>SmartHome</code> struct combines the individual components into a single cohesive system. Each component is responsible for its own behavior, and the <code>SmartHome</code> struct orchestrates interactions between these components. This design not only promotes code reuse and modularity but also adheres to Rustâ€™s principles of ownership and safety, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By using composition to build complex types, Rust developers can create flexible and scalable systems that leverage the strengths of Rustâ€™s type system and ownership model. This approach fosters a clean, modular design, making it easier to manage and extend the functionality of complex systems.
</p>

## 20.6. Comparison of Composition and Inheritance
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In software design, composition and inheritance are two fundamental approaches for building complex types and managing relationships between them. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help in choosing the most appropriate design pattern for a given problem. In Rust, which emphasizes composition over inheritance, these concepts are implemented differently compared to traditional object-oriented languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, forming a hierarchical relationship. This approach promotes code reuse by enabling derived classes to reuse and extend the functionality of base classes. However, inheritance can lead to tight coupling between classes, which can make the system difficult to modify and maintain. Inheritance can also create deep and complex class hierarchies that are hard to understand and manage.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, inheritance is not a feature of the language. Instead, Rust encourages composition and uses traits to achieve similar outcomes. Composition involves creating complex types by combining simpler, reusable components. This approach promotes flexibility and modularity by allowing components to be swapped, extended, or replaced without affecting other parts of the system. Rustâ€™s traits provide a way to define shared behavior across different types without forming an inheritance hierarchy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the difference between composition and inheritance, consider a scenario where we need to model different types of <code>Animal</code> with their specific behaviors. We will create two versions: one using composition (Rust-style) and one using inheritance (traditional object-oriented style).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, we use structs and traits to model the behavior of animals through composition. We define a base <code>Animal</code> trait that specifies common behaviors and implement this trait for specific animal types.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how you might model this using composition:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Animal trait with common behavior
trait Animal {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str;
    fn move_(&self) -> &str;
}

// Define the Dog struct with its specific behavior
struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str {
        "Bark"
    }

    fn move_(&self) -> &str {
        "Runs"
    }
}

// Define the Cat struct with its specific behavior
struct Cat;

impl Animal for Cat {
    fn sound(&self) -> &str {
        "Meow"
    }

    fn move_(&self) -> &str {
        "Prowls"
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    println!("Dog: {} and {}", dog.sound(), dog.move_());
    println!("Cat: {} and {}", cat.sound(), cat.move_());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Animal</code> trait defines common behaviors like <code>sound</code> and <code>move_</code>. Both <code>Dog</code> and <code>Cat</code> structs implement the <code>Animal</code> trait, providing their specific implementations for these behaviors. This design demonstrates how composition can be used to achieve polymorphism without relying on inheritance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To compare, hereâ€™s how you might model the same scenario using inheritance in an object-oriented language like Python:
</p>

{{< prism lang="python" line-numbers="true">}}
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def move(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

    def move(self):
        return "Runs"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

    def move(self):
        return "Prowls"

def main():
    dog = Dog()
    cat = Cat()

    print(f"Dog: {dog.sound()} and {dog.move()}")
    print(f"Cat: {cat.sound()} and {cat.move()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Python example, the <code>Animal</code> class serves as a base class with abstract methods <code>sound</code> and <code>move</code>. The <code>Dog</code> and <code>Cat</code> classes inherit from <code>Animal</code> and provide their implementations for these methods. This design highlights how inheritance can be used to share and extend behavior, but it also introduces tight coupling between the base class and derived classes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The composition approach in Rust offers several advantages over inheritance. Composition fosters a more modular design by allowing components to be easily swapped and extended without affecting other parts of the system. It also avoids issues related to deep inheritance hierarchies and tight coupling, making the system easier to understand and maintain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance, while providing a straightforward way to extend behavior, can lead to complex class hierarchies and tight coupling between base and derived classes. Changes in the base class can propagate through the hierarchy, potentially causing unintended side effects. Inheritance can also make it difficult to modify or extend behavior without altering existing classes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s focus on composition and traits aligns with its emphasis on safety, performance, and modularity. By using traits and struct composition, Rust enables developers to create flexible and maintainable systems while avoiding the pitfalls of deep inheritance hierarchies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
While inheritance and composition are both valuable techniques in software design, Rustâ€™s emphasis on composition offers a more flexible and modular approach. By leveraging traits and structs, Rust developers can build complex systems that are easier to understand, extend, and maintain.
</p>

### 20.6.1. When to Use Composition
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition is a powerful design principle in Rust that involves building complex types by combining simpler, reusable components. This approach offers significant advantages over inheritance, especially in terms of flexibility, modularity, and maintainability. Knowing when to use composition can help you design systems that are both robust and adaptable to change.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One primary scenario for using composition is when you want to build complex types from smaller, well-defined components. For instance, consider a <code>Car</code> struct that should have various features like an engine, transmission, and navigation system. Each of these features can be modeled as separate structs, and the <code>Car</code> struct can aggregate these components. This approach allows you to encapsulate the functionality of each component, making it easier to manage and modify individual parts of the system without affecting others.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s an example of using composition to model a <code>Car</code> with an <code>Engine</code>, <code>Transmission</code>, and <code>NavigationSystem</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Engine struct
struct Engine {
    horsepower: u32,
    fuel_type: String,
}

impl Engine {
    fn new(horsepower: u32, fuel_type: String) -> Self {
        Engine { horsepower, fuel_type }
    }

    fn start(&self) {
        println!("Engine with {} horsepower started.", self.horsepower);
    }
}

// Define the Transmission struct
struct Transmission {
    transmission_type: String,
}

impl Transmission {
    fn new(transmission_type: String) -> Self {
        Transmission { transmission_type }
    }

    fn shift(&self) {
        println!("Transmission type: {} shifted.", self.transmission_type);
    }
}

// Define the NavigationSystem struct
struct NavigationSystem {
    has_gps: bool,
}

impl NavigationSystem {
    fn new(has_gps: bool) -> Self {
        NavigationSystem { has_gps }
    }

    fn navigate(&self) {
        if self.has_gps {
            println!("Navigating with GPS.");
        } else {
            println!("No GPS available for navigation.");
        }
    }
}

// Define the Car struct with composition
struct Car {
    engine: Engine,
    transmission: Transmission,
    navigation_system: NavigationSystem,
}

impl Car {
    fn new(engine: Engine, transmission: Transmission, navigation_system: NavigationSystem) -> Self {
        Car {
            engine,
            transmission,
            navigation_system,
        }
    }

    fn start(&self) {
        self.engine.start();
        self.transmission.shift();
        self.navigation_system.navigate();
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create instances of the components
    let engine = Engine::new(300, "Gasoline".to_string());
    let transmission = Transmission::new("Automatic".to_string());
    let navigation_system = NavigationSystem::new(true);

    // Create an instance of Car
    let car = Car::new(engine, transmission, navigation_system);

    // Start the car
    car.start();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Car</code> struct uses composition to include <code>Engine</code>, <code>Transmission</code>, and <code>NavigationSystem</code> as components. This design allows the <code>Car</code> struct to delegate specific tasks to its components, encapsulating the functionality of each part and promoting a clear separation of concerns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another scenario where composition is advantageous is when you need to provide different configurations or behaviors dynamically. Composition allows you to swap out or extend components without altering the overall system. For instance, if you need a <code>SmartHome</code> system where the type of security system or thermostat can change, you can use composition to easily replace or update these components.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a <code>SmartHome</code> system that can use different types of security systems, such as a <code>BasicSecuritySystem</code> or an <code>AdvancedSecuritySystem</code>. By using composition, you can easily switch between these systems without modifying the core <code>SmartHome</code> struct:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a basic security system
struct BasicSecuritySystem {
    is_armed: bool,
}

impl BasicSecuritySystem {
    fn new(is_armed: bool) -> Self {
        BasicSecuritySystem { is_armed }
    }

    fn arm(&mut self) {
        self.is_armed = true;
    }

    fn disarm(&mut self) {
        self.is_armed = false;
    }
}

// Define an advanced security system with additional features
struct AdvancedSecuritySystem {
    is_armed: bool,
    has_cameras: bool,
}

impl AdvancedSecuritySystem {
    fn new(is_armed: bool, has_cameras: bool) -> Self {
        AdvancedSecuritySystem { is_armed, has_cameras }
    }

    fn arm(&mut self) {
        self.is_armed = true;
    }

    fn disarm(&mut self) {
        self.is_armed = false;
    }

    fn activate_cameras(&self) {
        if self.has_cameras {
            println!("Cameras activated.");
        } else {
            println!("No cameras available.");
        }
    }
}

// Define a common trait for security systems
trait SecuritySystem {
    fn arm(&mut self);
    fn disarm(&mut self);
}

// Implement the trait for BasicSecuritySystem
impl SecuritySystem for BasicSecuritySystem {
    fn arm(&mut self) {
        self.arm();
    }

    fn disarm(&mut self) {
        self.disarm();
    }
}

// Implement the trait for AdvancedSecuritySystem
impl SecuritySystem for AdvancedSecuritySystem {
    fn arm(&mut self) {
        self.arm();
    }

    fn disarm(&mut self) {
        self.disarm();
    }
}

// Define the SmartHome struct with a composable security system
struct SmartHome<T> {
    security_system: T,
}

impl<T> SmartHome<T> 
where 
    T: SecuritySystem 
{
    fn new(security_system: T) -> Self {
        SmartHome { security_system }
    }

    fn arm_security(&mut self) {
        self.security_system.arm();
    }

    fn disarm_security(&mut self) {
        self.security_system.disarm();
    }
}

// Define an extended SmartHome for advanced security systems
struct AdvancedSmartHome {
    security_system: AdvancedSecuritySystem,
}

impl AdvancedSmartHome {
    fn new(security_system: AdvancedSecuritySystem) -> Self {
        AdvancedSmartHome { security_system }
    }

    fn activate_cameras(&self) {
        self.security_system.activate_cameras();
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create instances of different security systems
    let basic_system = BasicSecuritySystem::new(false);
    let advanced_system = AdvancedSecuritySystem::new(false, true);

    // Create SmartHome instances with different security systems
    let mut basic_home = SmartHome::new(basic_system);
    let mut advanced_home = AdvancedSmartHome::new(advanced_system);

    // Manage basic security system
    basic_home.arm_security();

    // Manage advanced security system
    advanced_home.activate_cameras();
    advanced_home.security_system.arm();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this <code>SmartHome</code> example, the system is designed to work with any type of security system that implements the <code>SecuritySystem</code> trait. This design allows for flexible and dynamic configuration of the security system, showcasing the benefits of composition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Composition is especially useful when you want to build complex types from simpler components, when you need flexibility in configuring or extending behavior, and when you want to avoid the pitfalls of deep inheritance hierarchies. By leveraging composition, you can create modular, maintainable, and adaptable systems that align with Rustâ€™s emphasis on safety and performance.
</p>

### 20.6.2. When Inheritance Might Be Suitable
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance in Rust, though less common compared to languages with traditional class-based inheritance, can still be useful in certain scenarios. Rust uses traits to provide a form of inheritance through trait implementation, allowing you to share functionality and extend behavior across different types. However, there are specific cases where leveraging inheritance-like patterns can be advantageous.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One situation where inheritance might be suitable is when you have a clear hierarchy of types that share common behavior. In such cases, defining a base trait with common functionality and then implementing it for various derived types can simplify your design. For example, if you are building a graphical application where different shapes share common methods like <code>draw</code> and <code>area</code>, you can use a base trait to define these methods and then implement it for specific shapes like <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following example where we define a base trait <code>Shape</code> with common methods, and then implement it for different shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a base trait for shapes
trait Shape {
    fn draw(&self);
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

// Implement the Shape trait for a Circle
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Circle {
    fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {
        Circle { radius }
    }
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle with radius {}", self.radius);
    }

    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}

// Implement the Shape trait for a Rectangle
struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {
        Rectangle { width, height }
    }
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a rectangle with width {} and height {}", self.width, self.height);
    }

    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle::new(5.0);
    let rectangle = Rectangle::new(4.0, 6.0);

    let shapes: Vec<&dyn Shape> = vec![&circle, &rectangle];

    for shape in shapes {
        shape.draw();
        println!("Area: {}", shape.area());
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Shape</code> trait acts as a base type, providing a common interface for drawing shapes and calculating their areas. The <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code> structs each implement the <code>Shape</code> trait, defining their specific behavior for the <code>draw</code> and <code>area</code> methods. This allows for polymorphism, where different shapes can be treated uniformly through the <code>Shape</code> trait, and their specific implementations can be invoked.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance might also be suitable when you need to implement a default behavior that can be extended or overridden by derived types. In Rust, you can provide default method implementations in traits, which allows you to create a base behavior that derived types can either use as-is or override with their own specific implementation. This approach is useful when you want to provide common functionality while allowing flexibility for specialized behavior in derived types.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, if you are creating a logging system with different types of loggers, you might define a base trait <code>Logger</code> with default methods for logging messages:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Logger {
    fn log(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Logging message: {}", message);
    }

    fn error(&self, message: &str) {
        self.log(&format!("ERROR: {}", message));
    }
}

// Implement the Logger trait for a ConsoleLogger
struct ConsoleLogger;

impl Logger for ConsoleLogger {}

fn main() {
    let logger = ConsoleLogger;
    logger.log("This is a log message.");
    logger.error("This is an error message.");
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Logger</code> trait provides default implementations for the <code>log</code> and <code>error</code> methods. The <code>ConsoleLogger</code> struct implements the <code>Logger</code> trait without needing to override these methods, as the default behavior is sufficient. This pattern can be extended to create more specialized loggers that override the default methods if needed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance might also be suitable in scenarios where you need to manage shared state or behavior across multiple types. For instance, if you are developing a system where various types share some common configuration or initialization logic, defining a base trait or struct with this shared behavior can reduce code duplication and centralize the management of state.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance-like patterns in Rust, facilitated by traits, can be useful when you need to define a common interface for different types, provide default behavior that can be extended or overridden, or manage shared state across multiple types. By leveraging traits and default method implementations, you can create flexible and maintainable designs that align with Rust's emphasis on safety and performance.
</p>

## 20.7. Trade-offs and Best Practices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When deciding whether to use composition or inheritance in Rust, it's important to weigh the trade-offs associated with each approach. Rust emphasizes composition over inheritance, primarily due to its focus on safety, performance, and modularity. However, understanding the trade-offs and best practices can help you make informed decisions about which approach to use in different scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the main trade-offs between composition and inheritance is flexibility versus simplicity. Composition allows for more flexible and modular designs, as it lets you build complex types by combining simpler components. This approach promotes the use of traits and structs to encapsulate and reuse functionality in a decoupled manner. For instance, in Rust, you can define a trait with common behavior and then implement it for various structs. This allows you to create complex types by composing these structs and traits together, resulting in more maintainable and adaptable code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following example where we use composition to build a logging system. We define a <code>Logger</code> trait and two concrete implementations: <code>ConsoleLogger</code> and <code>FileLogger</code>. Then, we create a <code>LoggerManager</code> struct that uses composition to manage multiple loggers:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Logger {
    fn log(&self, message: &str);
}

struct ConsoleLogger;

impl Logger for ConsoleLogger {
    fn log(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Console: {}", message);
    }
}

struct FileLogger;

impl Logger for FileLogger {
    fn log(&self, message: &str) {
        // Simulate writing to a file
        println!("File: {}", message);
    }
}

struct LoggerManager {
    loggers: Vec<Box<dyn Logger>>,
}

impl LoggerManager {
    fn new() -> Self {
        LoggerManager { loggers: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_logger(&mut self, logger: Box<dyn Logger>) {
        self.loggers.push(logger);
    }

    fn log_all(&self, message: &str) {
        for logger in &self.loggers {
            logger.log(message);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let console_logger = Box::new(ConsoleLogger);
    let file_logger = Box::new(FileLogger);

    let mut manager = LoggerManager::new();
    manager.add_logger(console_logger);
    manager.add_logger(file_logger);

    manager.log_all("Hello, world!");
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>LoggerManager</code> uses composition to manage different types of loggers, allowing for a flexible and extensible logging system. The <code>Logger</code> trait defines a common interface for logging, and concrete implementations handle the specifics of logging to the console or file. This design is modular and easily extendable, as you can add new types of loggers without modifying the existing code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
On the other hand, inheritance-like patterns can sometimes lead to simpler designs when dealing with well-defined hierarchies. For example, if you have a clear and stable hierarchy where shared behavior can be easily encapsulated in a base trait, using inheritance can be more straightforward. However, this approach can also lead to tight coupling and less flexibility, as changes to the base trait may impact all derived types.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a scenario where you have a base trait <code>Animal</code> and two derived traits: <code>Mammal</code> and <code>Bird</code>. Each derived trait extends the base trait with specific behavior:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Animal {
    fn eat(&self);
}

trait Mammal: Animal {
    fn walk(&self);
}

trait Bird: Animal {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Dog;

impl Animal for Dog {
    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("Dog eats.");
    }
}

impl Mammal for Dog {
    fn walk(&self) {
        println!("Dog walks.");
    }
}

struct Sparrow;

impl Animal for Sparrow {
    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("Sparrow eats.");
    }
}

impl Bird for Sparrow {
    fn fly(&self) {
        println!("Sparrow flies.");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let sparrow = Sparrow;

    dog.eat();
    dog.walk();

    sparrow.eat();
    sparrow.fly();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Mammal</code> and <code>Bird</code> traits extend the base <code>Animal</code> trait, providing additional behavior specific to mammals and birds, respectively. This design works well for cases where the hierarchy is clear and stable, and the shared behavior can be easily encapsulated in the base trait.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When choosing between composition and inheritance, it's crucial to consider best practices. Rust's preference for composition encourages you to use traits and structs to build flexible and modular designs. Composition promotes code reuse without the drawbacks of deep inheritance hierarchies, which can lead to fragile and tightly coupled code. By using traits to define shared behavior and structs to implement and combine this behavior, you can create designs that are both maintainable and adaptable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
While inheritance can simplify certain hierarchical designs, Rust's emphasis on composition offers greater flexibility and modularity. By understanding the trade-offs and best practices associated with each approach, you can make informed decisions that align with Rust's principles of safety and performance.
</p>

### 20.7.1. Case Studies and Examples
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Case studies are valuable for illustrating how theoretical concepts are applied in practical scenarios. In the context of Rust, case studies can showcase how composition and inheritance patterns are used to solve real-world problems effectively. By examining these examples, we can gain insights into best practices and potential pitfalls in Rust programming.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One practical example of using composition in Rust is developing a modular system for managing different types of notifications in an application. Imagine you are building an application that needs to send notifications through various channels, such as email, SMS, and push notifications. Using composition allows you to define a common interface for sending notifications and then implement it for different types of notification channels. This approach promotes flexibility and scalability, as you can easily add or modify notification channels without altering the core notification logic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how you might implement this in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a trait for notification sending
trait Notifier {
    fn send(&self, message: &str);
}

// Implement the Notifier trait for Email notifications
struct EmailNotifier {
    email_address: String,
}

impl EmailNotifier {
    fn new(email_address: &str) -> Self {
        EmailNotifier {
            email_address: email_address.to_string(),
        }
    }
}

impl Notifier for EmailNotifier {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Sending email to {}: {}", self.email_address, message);
    }
}

// Implement the Notifier trait for SMS notifications
struct SmsNotifier {
    phone_number: String,
}

impl SmsNotifier {
    fn new(phone_number: &str) -> Self {
        SmsNotifier {
            phone_number: phone_number.to_string(),
        }
    }
}

impl Notifier for SmsNotifier {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Sending SMS to {}: {}", self.phone_number, message);
    }
}

// Define a NotificationManager that uses composition
struct NotificationManager<T> {
    notifier: T,
}

impl<T> NotificationManager<T>
where
    T: Notifier,
{
    fn new(notifier: T) -> Self {
        NotificationManager { notifier }
    }

    fn notify(&self, message: &str) {
        self.notifier.send(message);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let email_notifier = EmailNotifier::new("example@example.com");
    let sms_notifier = SmsNotifier::new("+1234567890");

    let email_manager = NotificationManager::new(email_notifier);
    let sms_manager = NotificationManager::new(sms_notifier);

    email_manager.notify("Hello via email!");
    sms_manager.notify("Hello via SMS!");
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Notifier</code> trait defines a common interface for sending notifications. <code>EmailNotifier</code> and <code>SmsNotifier</code> implement this trait, each handling the specifics of their respective notification channels. The <code>NotificationManager</code> struct uses composition to manage notifications, making it easy to extend or modify notification channels by adding new implementations of the <code>Notifier</code> trait.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another case study involves using inheritance-like patterns in a game development scenario where you have different types of game characters with shared and specific behaviors. Suppose you are developing a game with various types of characters, such as <code>Warrior</code> and <code>Mage</code>, each with some common abilities but also unique characteristics. Using traits allows you to define a common interface and then extend it for specific types of characters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s an example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a trait for common character behavior
trait Character {
    fn attack(&self);
    fn defend(&self);
}

// Implement the Character trait for a Warrior
struct Warrior {
    name: String,
}

impl Warrior {
    fn new(name: &str) -> Self {
        Warrior {
            name: name.to_string(),
        }
    }

    fn special_ability(&self) {
        println!("{} performs a powerful charge attack!", self.name);
    }
}

impl Character for Warrior {
    fn attack(&self) {
        println!("{} attacks with a sword!", self.name);
    }

    fn defend(&self) {
        println!("{} defends with a shield!", self.name);
    }
}

// Implement the Character trait for a Mage
struct Mage {
    name: String,
}

impl Mage {
    fn new(name: &str) -> Self {
        Mage {
            name: name.to_string(),
        }
    }

    fn cast_spell(&self) {
        println!("{} casts a fireball spell!", self.name);
    }
}

impl Character for Mage {
    fn attack(&self) {
        println!("{} attacks with a magic staff!", self.name);
    }

    fn defend(&self) {
        println!("{} uses a magic shield!", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let warrior = Warrior::new("Aragorn");
    let mage = Mage::new("Gandalf");

    warrior.attack();
    warrior.defend();
    warrior.special_ability();

    mage.attack();
    mage.defend();
    mage.cast_spell();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case study, the <code>Character</code> trait provides a common interface for attacking and defending. Both <code>Warrior</code> and <code>Mage</code> structs implement this trait, allowing them to share common behavior while also defining their unique abilities. This design allows you to create and manage different types of characters in a flexible and extensible manner.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Case studies in Rust often reveal that composition provides greater flexibility and modularity, especially in scenarios where components need to be easily combined and extended. Inheritance-like patterns, facilitated by traits, can simplify designs when dealing with well-defined hierarchies and shared behavior. By understanding and applying these patterns, you can create robust and maintainable Rust applications that effectively leverage the strengths of both composition and inheritance.
</p>

### 20.7.2. Real-world Scenarios of Composition in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, composition is a powerful and versatile approach to building systems and managing complexity. Real-world scenarios often leverage composition to create modular, maintainable, and flexible designs. This approach is particularly beneficial when dealing with systems that require extensibility and adaptability. Below are some illustrative examples of how composition can be effectively applied in real-world Rust projects.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a scenario where you are building a configuration management system for an application. In such a system, different components might need to load configurations from various sources, such as files, environment variables, or remote servers. Using composition allows you to design a flexible configuration system where components can be easily swapped or extended without modifying the core logic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate this, letâ€™s define a trait <code>ConfigSource</code> that provides a common interface for loading configuration data. We will then create concrete implementations for different sources: a file-based configuration, an environment variable configuration, and a remote configuration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how you might implement this:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::env;

// Define a trait for configuration sources
trait ConfigSource {
    fn load(&self) -> HashMap<String, String>;
}

// Implement the ConfigSource trait for file-based configuration
struct FileConfig {
    file_path: String,
}

impl FileConfig {
    fn new(file_path: &str) -> Self {
        FileConfig {
            file_path: file_path.to_string(),
        }
    }
}

impl ConfigSource for FileConfig {
    fn load(&self) -> HashMap<String, String> {
        let mut config = HashMap::new();
        // Simulate loading from a file
        config.insert("database_url".to_string(), "file_db_url".to_string());
        config
    }
}

// Implement the ConfigSource trait for environment variable configuration
struct EnvConfig;

impl ConfigSource for EnvConfig {
    fn load(&self) -> HashMap<String, String> {
        let mut config = HashMap::new();
        if let Ok(db_url) = env::var("DATABASE_URL") {
            config.insert("database_url".to_string(), db_url);
        }
        config
    }
}

// Implement the ConfigSource trait for remote configuration
struct RemoteConfig {
    endpoint: String,
}

impl RemoteConfig {
    fn new(endpoint: &str) -> Self {
        RemoteConfig {
            endpoint: endpoint.to_string(),
        }
    }
}

impl ConfigSource for RemoteConfig {
    fn load(&self) -> HashMap<String, String> {
        let mut config = HashMap::new();
        // Simulate loading from a remote server
        config.insert("database_url".to_string(), "remote_db_url".to_string());
        config
    }
}

// Define a ConfigurationManager that uses composition
struct ConfigurationManager<T> {
    source: T,
}

impl<T> ConfigurationManager<T>
where
    T: ConfigSource,
{
    fn new(source: T) -> Self {
        ConfigurationManager { source }
    }

    fn get_config(&self) -> HashMap<String, String> {
        self.source.load()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let file_config = FileConfig::new("config.toml");
    let env_config = EnvConfig;
    let remote_config = RemoteConfig::new("http://config.example.com");

    let file_manager = ConfigurationManager::new(file_config);
    let env_manager = ConfigurationManager::new(env_config);
    let remote_manager = ConfigurationManager::new(remote_config);

    println!("{:?}", file_manager.get_config());
    println!("{:?}", env_manager.get_config());
    println!("{:?}", remote_manager.get_config());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>ConfigSource</code> is a trait that defines a method for loading configuration data. Different configuration sources (<code>FileConfig</code>, <code>EnvConfig</code>, <code>RemoteConfig</code>) implement this trait, each handling the specifics of loading configuration data from its respective source. The <code>ConfigurationManager</code> struct uses composition to manage configurations from various sources, providing a unified interface to access configuration data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another real-world scenario where composition is highly beneficial is in the development of a web application with various types of middleware. Middleware components in a web application can handle tasks such as logging, authentication, and request modification. By composing these middleware components, you can create a flexible and extensible request-handling pipeline.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s look at an example where we define a trait <code>Middleware</code> for processing requests, and then implement different middleware components:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define a trait for middleware components
trait Middleware {
    fn handle(&self, request: &str) -> String;
}

// Implement Middleware for logging
struct LoggingMiddleware;

impl Middleware for LoggingMiddleware {
    fn handle(&self, request: &str) -> String {
        println!("Logging request: {}", request);
        request.to_string() // Pass request through
    }
}

// Implement Middleware for authentication
struct AuthenticationMiddleware;

impl Middleware for AuthenticationMiddleware {
    fn handle(&self, request: &str) -> String {
        // Simulate authentication check
        if request.contains("token") {
            println!("Authenticated request.");
            request.to_string() // Pass request through
        } else {
            println!("Authentication failed.");
            "Unauthorized".to_string()
        }
    }
}

// Define a MiddlewareManager that uses composition
struct MiddlewareManager {
    middlewares: Vec<Box<dyn Middleware>>,
}

impl MiddlewareManager {
    fn new(middlewares: Vec<Box<dyn Middleware>>) -> Self {
        MiddlewareManager { middlewares }
    }

    fn process_request(&self, request: &str) -> String {
        let mut processed_request = request.to_string();
        for middleware in &self.middlewares {
            processed_request = middleware.handle(&processed_request);
            if processed_request == "Unauthorized" {
                break;
            }
        }
        processed_request
    }
}

fn main() {
    let middlewares: Vec<Box<dyn Middleware>> = vec![
        Box::new(LoggingMiddleware),
        Box::new(AuthenticationMiddleware),
    ];

    let manager = MiddlewareManager::new(middlewares);
    let request = "GET /resource?token=abc123";

    let response = manager.process_request(request);
    println!("Response: {}", response);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Middleware</code> trait defines a method for handling requests. Two concrete middleware components, <code>LoggingMiddleware</code> and <code>AuthenticationMiddleware</code>, implement this trait. The <code>MiddlewareManager</code> struct uses composition to manage and apply these middleware components in sequence, creating a flexible and extensible request-processing pipeline.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These examples demonstrate how composition can be used in real-world scenarios to create modular, maintainable, and flexible systems. By defining common interfaces with traits and implementing them for various components, you can build complex systems with ease while keeping the codebase clean and adaptable.
</p>

## 20.8. Comparing with Inheritance-Based Designs
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, composition and inheritance are two fundamental design approaches for organizing code and managing complexity. While Rust does not support traditional class-based inheritance like some object-oriented languages, it provides alternatives such as traits and composition to achieve similar goals. Understanding how composition compares with inheritance-based designs can provide insights into when and why to use each approach.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Inheritance is a design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming to create a new class based on an existing class. This allows the new class to inherit properties and behaviors from the existing class, enabling code reuse and extending functionality. Inheritance often creates a hierarchical structure of classes, where subclasses inherit from superclasses. This can lead to tightly coupled code and deep inheritance hierarchies that are difficult to manage and extend.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust, however, embraces composition over inheritance. Composition involves building complex types by combining simpler ones rather than extending them through a hierarchy. In Rust, this is typically achieved using structs and traits. This approach encourages more modular and flexible designs, as components are loosely coupled and can be replaced or extended independently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s compare these approaches using a practical example. Consider a scenario where we are designing a system for processing different types of documents, such as text documents and spreadsheets.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In an inheritance-based design, we might create a base class <code>Document</code> with common properties and methods, and then extend it with subclasses for specific document types:
</p>

{{< prism lang="cpp" line-numbers="true">}}
// C++ example: Inheritance-based design
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Document {
public:
    virtual void print() = 0;
};

class TextDocument : public Document {
public:
    void print() override {
        std::cout << "Printing text document." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Spreadsheet : public Document {
public:
    void print() override {
        std::cout << "Printing spreadsheet." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Document* doc1 = new TextDocument();
    Document* doc2 = new Spreadsheet();
    
    doc1->print();
    doc2->print();
    
    delete doc1;
    delete doc2;
    
    return 0;
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this C++ example, <code>Document</code> is an abstract base class, and <code>TextDocument</code> and <code>Spreadsheet</code> are concrete subclasses that inherit from <code>Document</code>. This design works well for simple hierarchies but can become problematic with deep or complex hierarchies, leading to tight coupling and difficulties in extending functionality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, we use traits to define shared behavior and structs to hold data. Composition allows us to create flexible systems by combining traits and structs:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Rust example: Composition-based design

trait Printable {
    fn print(&self);
}

struct TextDocument;

impl Printable for TextDocument {
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("Printing text document.");
    }
}

struct Spreadsheet;

impl Printable for Spreadsheet {
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("Printing spreadsheet.");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let text_doc = TextDocument;
    let spreadsheet = Spreadsheet;
    
    text_doc.print();
    spreadsheet.print();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust example, <code>Printable</code> is a trait that defines the <code>print</code> method. Both <code>TextDocument</code> and <code>Spreadsheet</code> structs implement this trait. This approach allows for more flexible and modular designs, as the <code>Printable</code> trait can be implemented by any type, and types are not tightly coupled through inheritance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The key difference between inheritance and composition in Rust lies in the flexibility and modularity of the design. Inheritance creates a hierarchy where subclasses inherit properties and methods from a base class, often resulting in tightly coupled code. This can make it challenging to extend or modify the behavior of individual components without affecting the entire hierarchy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In contrast, Rustâ€™s composition-based design uses traits to define shared behaviors and structs to represent data. This approach encourages loose coupling, making it easier to manage and extend functionality. By defining behaviors in traits and combining them in structs, you can create complex types without being constrained by a rigid inheritance hierarchy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, Rustâ€™s approach allows for better encapsulation and code reuse. Traits can be implemented by multiple structs, and you can easily add new behaviors by defining additional traits or modifying existing ones. This leads to more maintainable and adaptable code, as changes to one part of the system are less likely to impact other parts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
While inheritance can be useful in certain contexts, Rustâ€™s composition-based design provides greater flexibility and modularity, making it a more robust choice for managing complexity in modern software development.
</p>

### 20.8.1. Rustâ€™s Approach to Encapsulation and Abstraction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's approach to encapsulation and abstraction differs significantly from traditional object-oriented languages that rely heavily on inheritance. Instead, Rust employs a combination of ownership, borrowing, traits, and modules to achieve these design principles. This methodology not only aligns with Rustâ€™s goals of safety and concurrency but also promotes clarity and maintainability in code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation in Rust is achieved by controlling access to the data and methods within a struct. By default, all fields and methods in a struct are private to the module in which they are defined. To expose them to other parts of the program, the <code>pub</code> keyword is used. This enables the creation of clear and controlled interfaces while hiding implementation details. For instance, consider the example of a <code>BankAccount</code> struct that encapsulates a balance field and provides methods to interact with this balance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod bank {
    pub struct BankAccount {
        balance: f64,
    }

    impl BankAccount {
        pub fn new(initial_balance: f64) -> Self {
            BankAccount {
                balance: initial_balance,
            }
        }

        pub fn deposit(&mut self, amount: f64) {
            self.balance += amount;
        }

        pub fn withdraw(&mut self, amount: f64) -> Result<(), String> {
            if self.balance >= amount {
                self.balance -= amount;
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Insufficient funds".to_string())
            }
        }

        pub fn get_balance(&self) -> f64 {
            self.balance
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut account = bank::BankAccount::new(100.0);
    account.deposit(50.0);
    match account.withdraw(30.0) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Withdrawal successful!"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
    println!("Current balance: {}", account.get_balance());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>BankAccount</code> struct's balance is private, ensuring it cannot be modified directly from outside the module. The public methods <code>new</code>, <code>deposit</code>, <code>withdraw</code>, and <code>get_balance</code> provide a controlled interface to interact with the balance. This encapsulation ensures that the balance is always manipulated in a valid and consistent manner.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Abstraction in Rust is primarily achieved through traits. Traits define shared behavior that can be implemented by different types. This allows the definition of interfaces without specifying concrete implementations, facilitating polymorphism and code reuse. Consider a trait <code>Notifier</code> that can be implemented by various types of notifiers:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Notifier {
    fn send(&self, message: &str);
}

struct EmailNotifier {
    email_address: String,
}

impl Notifier for EmailNotifier {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Sending email to {}: {}", self.email_address, message);
    }
}

struct SmsNotifier {
    phone_number: String,
}

impl Notifier for SmsNotifier {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Sending SMS to {}: {}", self.phone_number, message);
    }
}

fn notify<T: Notifier>(notifier: &T, message: &str) {
    notifier.send(message);
}

fn main() {
    let email_notifier = EmailNotifier {
        email_address: "example@example.com".to_string(),
    };
    let sms_notifier = SmsNotifier {
        phone_number: "123-456-7890".to_string(),
    };

    notify(&email_notifier, "Hello via email!");
    notify(&sms_notifier, "Hello via SMS!");
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Notifier</code> trait defines the <code>send</code> method. Both <code>EmailNotifier</code> and <code>SmsNotifier</code> structs implement this trait, providing their specific implementations for sending notifications. The generic <code>notify</code> function can accept any type that implements the <code>Notifier</code> trait, demonstrating how abstraction allows for flexible and reusable code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's module system further supports encapsulation and abstraction by organizing code into logical units and controlling visibility. Modules can encapsulate types, functions, and even other modules, exposing only what is necessary through the <code>pub</code> keyword. This promotes a clean separation of concerns and helps manage complexity in larger codebases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, extending the previous bank account example to include multiple modules:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod bank {
    pub struct BankAccount {
        balance: f64,
    }

    impl BankAccount {
        pub fn new(initial_balance: f64) -> Self {
            BankAccount {
                balance: initial_balance,
            }
        }

        pub fn deposit(&mut self, amount: f64) {
            self.balance += amount;
        }

        pub fn withdraw(&mut self, amount: f64) -> Result<(), String> {
            if self.balance >= amount {
                self.balance -= amount;
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Insufficient funds".to_string())
            }
        }

        pub fn get_balance(&self) -> f64 {
            self.balance
        }
    }
}

mod customer {
    pub struct Customer {
        name: String,
        pub account: super::bank::BankAccount,
    }

    impl Customer {
        pub fn new(name: &str, initial_balance: f64) -> Self {
            Customer {
                name: name.to_string(),
                account: super::bank::BankAccount::new(initial_balance),
            }
        }

        pub fn get_name(&self) -> &str {
            &self.name
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut customer = customer::Customer::new("Alice", 100.0);
    customer.account.deposit(50.0);
    match customer.account.withdraw(30.0) {
        Ok(_) => println!("Withdrawal successful!"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
    println!("Current balance for {}: {}", customer.get_name(), customer.account.get_balance());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the <code>bank</code> module encapsulates the <code>BankAccount</code> struct, while the <code>customer</code> module defines a <code>Customer</code> struct that includes a <code>BankAccount</code>. The <code>Customer</code> struct provides methods to interact with the bank account, demonstrating how modules can be used to organize and encapsulate different parts of a program.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s approach to encapsulation and abstraction leverages its unique features to provide robust, flexible, and maintainable solutions without relying on inheritance. By using structs, traits, generics, and modules, Rust allows developers to build complex systems with clear and controlled interfaces, promoting safety and concurrency while managing complexity effectively.
</p>

### 20.8.2. How Rust's Features Support Composition
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's features strongly support the composition over inheritance principle, promoting more flexible, modular, and maintainable code. Composition in Rust involves building complex types by combining simpler types, often using structs, enums, traits, and the module system. This approach contrasts with inheritance-based designs common in other languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, structs are the primary building blocks for composition. Structs allow you to define data types that group together related data. By embedding one struct within another, you can build more complex types. For instance, consider a <code>Point</code> struct and a <code>Rectangle</code> struct that uses <code>Point</code> to define its position and size:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

struct Rectangle {
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn new(top_left: Point, bottom_right: Point) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle { top_left, bottom_right }
    }

    fn area(&self) -> i32 {
        let width = self.bottom_right.x - self.top_left.x;
        let height = self.bottom_right.y - self.top_left.y;
        width * height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let top_left = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
    let bottom_right = Point { x: 5, y: 5 };
    let rect = Rectangle::new(top_left, bottom_right);
    println!("Area of the rectangle: {}", rect.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Rectangle</code> struct is composed of two <code>Point</code> structs. This demonstrates how composition allows you to build complex types by combining simpler, reusable components.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traits in Rust provide a way to define shared behavior across different types, supporting composition through polymorphism. Traits allow you to define methods that can be implemented by any type, enabling code reuse and abstraction. For instance, consider a trait <code>Shape</code> and its implementations for <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius
    }
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        2.0 * (self.width + self.height)
    }
}

fn print_shape_info(shape: &dyn Shape) {
    println!("Area: {}", shape.area());
    println!("Perimeter: {}", shape.perimeter());
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 3.0 };
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 4.0, height: 5.0 };
    print_shape_info(&circle);
    print_shape_info(&rectangle);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the <code>Shape</code> trait defines a common interface for calculating the area and perimeter. Both <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code> structs implement this trait, allowing them to be treated polymorphically. The <code>print_shape_info</code> function can operate on any type that implements the <code>Shape</code> trait, showcasing the power of composition and polymorphism in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's module system further supports composition by enabling the organization of code into logical units. Modules can encapsulate related types, functions, and traits, promoting modular design and reuse. For example, you can create a <code>geometry</code> module that contains various shapes and their implementations:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod geometry {
    pub mod shapes {
        pub struct Circle {
            pub radius: f64,
        }

        impl Circle {
            pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Circle {
                Circle { radius }
            }

            pub fn area(&self) -> f64 {
                std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
            }
        }

        pub struct Rectangle {
            pub width: f64,
            pub height: f64,
        }

        impl Rectangle {
            pub fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Rectangle {
                Rectangle { width, height }
            }

            pub fn area(&self) -> f64 {
                self.width * self.height
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = geometry::shapes::Circle::new(3.0);
    let rectangle = geometry::shapes::Rectangle::new(4.0, 5.0);
    println!("Circle area: {}", circle.area());
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", rectangle.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>geometry</code> module contains a <code>shapes</code> submodule, which includes the definitions and implementations of <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code>. This organization allows for clear separation of concerns, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Enums in Rust also play a crucial role in composition by enabling the definition of types that can represent multiple distinct variants. This is particularly useful for implementing state machines or handling various kinds of data within a single type. For example, consider an <code>enum</code> representing different shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum Shape {
    Circle { radius: f64 },
    Rectangle { width: f64, height: f64 },
}

impl Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        match *self {
            Shape::Circle { radius } => std::f64::consts::PI * radius * radius,
            Shape::Rectangle { width, height } => width * height,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Shape::Circle { radius: 3.0 };
    let rectangle = Shape::Rectangle { width: 4.0, height: 5.0 };
    println!("Circle area: {}", circle.area());
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", rectangle.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the <code>Shape</code> enum can represent either a <code>Circle</code> or a <code>Rectangle</code>, and its <code>area</code> method handles both variants. This use of enums allows for concise and expressive code, leveraging composition to handle different cases within a single type.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's support for composition is evident through its use of structs, traits, enums, and modules. These features allow developers to build complex systems from simple, reusable components, promoting flexibility, modularity, and maintainability. Rust's emphasis on composition over inheritance aligns with modern software design principles, providing powerful tools to create robust and scalable applications.
</p>

### 20.8.3. Encapsulation and Abstraction Without Inheritance
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation and abstraction are key principles in object-oriented programming that facilitate the creation of clean, maintainable, and modular code. Rust, despite not supporting classical inheritance, provides robust mechanisms to achieve encapsulation and abstraction, primarily through its use of structs, traits, and modules.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Encapsulation in Rust is about bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a struct, and controlling access to this data to protect the internal state. This is achieved using Rust's privacy rules. By default, all fields and methods in a Rust struct are private, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the struct. This encapsulation ensures that the internal state of the struct can only be modified through well-defined methods, preserving the integrity of the data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, consider a <code>Rectangle</code> struct that encapsulates its dimensions and provides methods to calculate its area and perimeter:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    pub fn new(width: u32, height: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle { width, height }
    }

    pub fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    pub fn perimeter(&self) -> u32 {
        2 * (self.width + self.height)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle::new(10, 20);
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
    println!("Perimeter: {}", rect.perimeter());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Rectangle</code> struct encapsulates the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields, making them private. The struct provides a public constructor method <code>new</code> to create a new <code>Rectangle</code> instance and public methods <code>area</code> and <code>perimeter</code> to calculate and return the rectangle's area and perimeter. This encapsulation ensures that the dimensions of the rectangle can only be set during creation and not modified directly, maintaining the integrity of the object's state.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Abstraction in Rust is about hiding the complex implementation details and providing a simple interface for interacting with objects. Rust achieves abstraction primarily through traits, which define shared behavior that can be implemented by multiple types. Traits allow you to define a common interface without specifying how the methods are implemented, promoting code reuse and flexibility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following example, where a trait <code>Shape</code> defines methods for calculating the area and perimeter, and this trait is implemented for different types of shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius
    }
}

struct Square {
    side: f64,
}

impl Shape for Square {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.side * self.side
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        4.0 * self.side
    }
}

fn print_shape_info(shape: &dyn Shape) {
    println!("Area: {}", shape.area());
    println!("Perimeter: {}", shape.perimeter());
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 3.0 };
    let square = Square { side: 4.0 };
    print_shape_info(&circle);
    print_shape_info(&square);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Shape</code> trait defines the abstract methods <code>area</code> and <code>perimeter</code>. The <code>Circle</code> and <code>Square</code> structs implement the <code>Shape</code> trait, providing their own concrete implementations for these methods. The <code>print_shape_info</code> function takes a reference to a <code>Shape</code> trait object and calls the <code>area</code> and <code>perimeter</code> methods, demonstrating how abstraction allows different shapes to be treated uniformly through a common interface.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's module system further enhances encapsulation and abstraction by enabling the organization of code into separate modules, each with its own namespace. This helps manage larger codebases by grouping related functionality together and controlling the visibility of items within each module. For instance, you can define a module <code>geometry</code> with nested modules and encapsulate the implementation details of various shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod geometry {
    pub mod shapes {
        pub struct Rectangle {
            pub width: u32,
            pub height: u32,
        }

        impl Rectangle {
            pub fn new(width: u32, height: u32) -> Rectangle {
                Rectangle { width, height }
            }

            pub fn area(&self) -> u32 {
                self.width * self.height
            }

            pub fn perimeter(&self) -> u32 {
                2 * (self.width + self.height)
            }
        }

        pub struct Circle {
            pub radius: f64,
        }

        impl Circle {
            pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Circle {
                Circle { radius }
            }

            pub fn area(&self) -> f64 {
                std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
            }

            pub fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
                2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = geometry::shapes::Rectangle::new(10, 20);
    let circ = geometry::shapes::Circle::new(5.0);
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", rect.area());
    println!("Circle area: {}", circ.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>geometry</code> module contains a nested <code>shapes</code> module, encapsulating the definitions and implementations of <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>. The public methods of these structs are accessible outside the module, while the internal implementation details are hidden, promoting encapsulation and abstraction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's support for encapsulation and abstraction without inheritance is robust and versatile. By using structs to encapsulate data, traits to define abstract behavior, and modules to organize code, Rust provides powerful tools to build clean, maintainable, and modular software. These features align with modern software design principles, encouraging developers to create flexible and reusable code without the pitfalls of traditional inheritance-based designs.
</p>

### 20.8.4. Best Practices and Patterns
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Best practices and patterns in Rust development revolve around creating code that is efficient, safe, maintainable, and idiomatic. Rust's unique features, such as its ownership system, type safety, and concurrency model, influence how developers approach these practices. Understanding these principles helps in writing robust and performant Rust code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the foundational practices in Rust is leveraging the ownership and borrowing system effectively. Ownership in Rust ensures memory safety without a garbage collector by tracking and enforcing strict rules on how memory is accessed. Each value in Rust has a single owner, and the value is dropped (deallocated) when its owner goes out of scope. Borrowing allows references to a value without transferring ownership, which can be either mutable or immutable. To write efficient and safe code, itâ€™s crucial to understand when to use ownership, borrowing, and references.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, consider a function that calculates the length of a string. Instead of taking ownership of the string, it borrows an immutable reference, allowing the caller to retain ownership of the string:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Hello, world!");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>calculate_length</code> borrows the string <code>s</code> without taking ownership, making it clear and efficient. This approach avoids unnecessary copying of data and ensures the original string remains available after the function call.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's type system and pattern matching are powerful tools for expressing complex logic succinctly and safely. Pattern matching with the <code>match</code> statement and destructuring with <code>let</code> bindings are idiomatic ways to handle different data variants and extract values. Enums are often used in conjunction with pattern matching to represent and manipulate different states or configurations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider an enum representing different types of messages and a function to process them:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn process_message(msg: Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quit message received."),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to coordinates ({}, {}).", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Write message: {}.", text),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Change color to RGB({}, {}, {}).", r, g, b),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let msg1 = Message::Quit;
    let msg2 = Message::Move { x: 10, y: 20 };
    let msg3 = Message::Write(String::from("Hello, Rust!"));
    let msg4 = Message::ChangeColor(255, 0, 0);

    process_message(msg1);
    process_message(msg2);
    process_message(msg3);
    process_message(msg4);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Message</code> enum represents various message types, and the <code>process_message</code> function uses pattern matching to handle each variant appropriately. This approach is concise, readable, and avoids runtime errors by ensuring all possible variants are handled.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Error handling in Rust is typically done using the <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types, which enforce safe and explicit error management. The <code>Result</code> type is used for operations that can succeed or fail, while the <code>Option</code> type is used for values that may or may not be present. Idiomatic Rust code leverages these types to handle errors and missing values gracefully without resorting to exceptions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, consider a function that reads a file and returns its contents:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_file(filename: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut file = File::open(filename)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

fn main() {
    match read_file("example.txt") {
        Ok(contents) => println!("File contents: {}", contents),
        Err(e) => println!("Error reading file: {}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the <code>read_file</code> function returns a <code>Result<String, io::Error></code>, making it clear that the operation can fail. The <code>?</code> operator is used to propagate errors automatically, simplifying error handling while maintaining clarity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Concurrency in Rust is safe and efficient thanks to its ownership system. Rust provides several concurrency primitives, such as threads, channels, and the <code>async/await</code> syntax for asynchronous programming. The ownership system ensures that data races and other concurrency issues are caught at compile time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, consider spawning multiple threads to perform concurrent tasks:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..10).map(|i| {
        thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("Thread {} is running", i);
        })
    }).collect();

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>main</code> function spawns ten threads, each printing its index. The <code>join</code> method ensures that the main thread waits for all spawned threads to complete. The <code>move</code> keyword ensures that each thread takes ownership of its captured variables, preventing data races.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Best practices and patterns in Rust involve leveraging the language's unique features to write safe, efficient, and maintainable code. Effective use of ownership and borrowing, pattern matching, error handling with <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code>, and safe concurrency primitives are crucial. By embracing these practices, developers can create robust Rust applications that adhere to the principles of modern software design.
</p>

### 20.8.5. Recommended Patterns for Composition
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, composition is favored over inheritance for structuring complex systems due to its flexibility and the language's emphasis on safety and performance. Recommended patterns for composition in Rust involve using structs, enums, traits, and modules to build modular and reusable code. These patterns leverage Rust's unique features to create robust and maintainable software designs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A fundamental pattern for composition in Rust is the use of structs to compose complex types from simpler, reusable components. Structs can contain other structs, allowing you to build up functionality incrementally. This approach promotes code reuse and encapsulation. For example, consider a <code>Library</code> struct that contains multiple <code>Book</code> structs. This design allows the library to manage a collection of books while keeping each book's details encapsulated:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    year: u32,
}

impl Book {
    fn new(title: String, author: String, year: u32) -> Book {
        Book { title, author, year }
    }

    fn display(&self) {
        println!("Title: {}, Author: {}, Year: {}", self.title, self.author, self.year);
    }
}

struct Library {
    books: Vec<Book>,
}

impl Library {
    fn new() -> Library {
        Library { books: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_book(&mut self, book: Book) {
        self.books.push(book);
    }

    fn display_books(&self) {
        for book in &self.books {
            book.display();
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut library = Library::new();
    library.add_book(Book::new(String::from("1984"), String::from("George Orwell"), 1949));
    library.add_book(Book::new(String::from("To Kill a Mockingbird"), String::from("Harper Lee"), 1960));
    
    library.display_books();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Library</code> struct encapsulates a collection of <code>Book</code> instances. Methods within <code>Library</code> manage the collection, demonstrating how composition allows for modular and organized code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another powerful pattern for composition in Rust is the use of enums combined with pattern matching. Enums can represent a type that can be one of several variants, and pattern matching enables handling each variant explicitly. This pattern is particularly useful for modeling complex state machines or handling different types of input. For instance, consider an enum <code>Operation</code> that represents different mathematical operations:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum Operation {
    Add(i32, i32),
    Subtract(i32, i32),
    Multiply(i32, i32),
    Divide(i32, i32),
}

fn calculate(op: Operation) -> i32 {
    match op {
        Operation::Add(a, b) => a + b,
        Operation::Subtract(a, b) => a - b,
        Operation::Multiply(a, b) => a * b,
        Operation::Divide(a, b) => {
            if b != 0 {
                a / b
            } else {
                panic!("Division by zero is not allowed");
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let sum = calculate(Operation::Add(10, 5));
    let difference = calculate(Operation::Subtract(10, 5));
    let product = calculate(Operation::Multiply(10, 5));
    let quotient = calculate(Operation::Divide(10, 2));

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
    println!("Difference: {}", difference);
    println!("Product: {}", product);
    println!("Quotient: {}", quotient);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the <code>Operation</code> enum defines different kinds of operations, and the <code>calculate</code> function uses pattern matching to handle each variant. This pattern provides a clear and expressive way to handle different states or actions in your code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traits are another essential pattern for composition in Rust, enabling you to define shared behavior that can be implemented by various types. Traits provide a way to abstract common functionality while allowing different types to provide their own implementations. For example, consider a <code>Drawable</code> trait with a method <code>draw</code>, which is implemented by different types of shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Drawable {
    fn draw(&self);
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Drawable for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle with radius {}", self.radius);
    }
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Drawable for Rectangle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a rectangle with width {} and height {}", self.width, self.height);
    }
}

fn draw_shape(shape: &dyn Drawable) {
    shape.draw();
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
    let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 10.0, height: 20.0 };
    
    draw_shape(&circle);
    draw_shape(&rectangle);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Drawable</code> trait defines a common interface for drawing shapes. Both <code>Circle</code> and <code>Rectangle</code> implement this trait, allowing the <code>draw_shape</code> function to work with any <code>Drawable</code> type. This pattern promotes code reuse and flexibility by allowing different types to provide their own implementations of the <code>draw</code> method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, Rust's module system supports composition by allowing you to organize code into logical units and manage visibility. Modules can encapsulate related types and functions, providing a clear structure for your codebase. For example, consider a <code>geometry</code> module that contains definitions for different shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod geometry {
    pub mod shapes {
        pub struct Circle {
            pub radius: f64,
        }

        impl Circle {
            pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Circle {
                Circle { radius }
            }

            pub fn area(&self) -> f64 {
                std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
            }
        }

        pub struct Rectangle {
            pub width: f64,
            pub height: f64,
        }

        impl Rectangle {
            pub fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Rectangle {
                Rectangle { width, height }
            }

            pub fn area(&self) -> f64 {
                self.width * self.height
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = geometry::shapes::Circle::new(3.0);
    let rectangle = geometry::shapes::Rectangle::new(4.0, 5.0);
    
    println!("Circle area: {}", circle.area());
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", rectangle.area());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>geometry</code> module organizes shapes into the <code>shapes</code> submodule. This design encapsulates the implementation details of each shape and provides a clear API for users of the module. The public visibility of the shapes' methods ensures that they can be used outside the module, while internal details remain hidden.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's recommended patterns for composition emphasize using structs to build complex types, enums for handling different variants, traits for defining shared behavior, and modules for organizing code. These patterns leverage Rust's strengths in safety and performance, promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code. By applying these patterns, developers can create well-structured Rust programs that adhere to best practices and effectively utilize the language's features.
</p>

### 20.8.6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, leveraging its features for safe and efficient programming involves understanding and avoiding common pitfalls. These pitfalls can lead to code that is either incorrect, inefficient, or difficult to maintain. By recognizing these issues and understanding how to address them, developers can write more robust and idiomatic Rust code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One common pitfall is mishandling ownership and borrowing, which can lead to data races, borrow checker errors, or unintentional data mutation. Rustâ€™s ownership system ensures that there are no data races by enforcing strict rules on how memory is accessed. A frequent issue arises when developers attempt to borrow mutable references while another mutable or immutable reference is in use. For example, consider the following code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let y = &x; // Immutable borrow
    let z = &mut x; // Error: cannot borrow `x` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    *z += 1;
    println!("y: {}, z: {}", y, z);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, attempting to create a mutable borrow (<code>z</code>) while an immutable borrow (<code>y</code>) is still active leads to a borrow checker error. To avoid such issues, ensure that mutable and immutable borrows do not overlap. If mutable access is needed, ensure no other borrows exist during the mutable borrow:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let y = &x; // Immutable borrow
    // Drop the immutable borrow before creating a mutable borrow
    drop(y);
    let z = &mut x; // Now mutable borrow is safe
    *z += 1;
    println!("z: {}", z);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another pitfall is incorrect handling of concurrency, which can lead to issues like data races or deadlocks. Rust provides concurrency primitives like threads and channels that are designed to be safe and prevent data races through its ownership model. However, misuse of these primitives can still lead to problems. For example, consider using threads without properly managing data access:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let data_clone = Arc::clone(&data);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = data_clone.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *data.lock().unwrap());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Arc</code> (atomic reference counting) and <code>Mutex</code> are used to safely share mutable data across threads. However, itâ€™s crucial to handle locking properly and avoid deadlocks. Ensuring that locks are acquired and released in a consistent order helps prevent such issues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Error handling is another area where pitfalls are common. Rust uses the <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types for explicit error handling, which avoids the problems associated with exceptions in other languages. However, ignoring or mismanaging these types can lead to unreliable code. For instance, consider the following code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn divide(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    x / y // Error: This can panic if y is zero
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10, 0);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case, dividing by zero will cause a panic. To handle such scenarios gracefully, use the <code>Result</code> type and properly handle potential errors:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn divide(x: u32, y: u32) -> Result<u32, String> {
    if y == 0 {
        Err(String::from("Cannot divide by zero"))
    } else {
        Ok(x / y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    match divide(10, 0) {
        Ok(result) => println!("Result: {}", result),
        Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this revised version, the <code>divide</code> function returns a <code>Result</code>, allowing the caller to handle errors explicitly rather than relying on panics. This approach ensures that the code can deal with errors in a controlled manner.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A more subtle pitfall is improper use of lifetimes, which can lead to lifetime-related errors or overly restrictive borrow rules. Lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as they are needed and no longer, but incorrect or unnecessary lifetime annotations can lead to errors or less optimal code. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn longest<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if s1.len() > s2.len() {
        s1
    } else {
        s2
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this function, both <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> must have the same lifetime <code>'a</code>, which might be overly restrictive. Sometimes, you might need more flexibility. Understanding and correctly applying lifetimes allows you to write more flexible and correct code. If necessary, re-evaluate the lifetime annotations and ensure they are as general as needed without being overly restrictive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, it's essential to understand and avoid the pitfalls associated with Rust's module system. Incorrectly managing visibility and module boundaries can lead to confusion and tightly coupled code. Properly structuring and encapsulating code into modules helps maintain a clear separation of concerns. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
mod network {
    pub struct Connection {
        // Implementation details
    }

    impl Connection {
        pub fn new() -> Connection {
            Connection {}
        }

        pub fn connect(&self) {
            // Connect logic
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let conn = network::Connection::new();
    conn.connect();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Connection</code> struct is public, but its implementation details remain encapsulated within the <code>network</code> module. This design promotes a clean interface while hiding implementation specifics, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Avoiding common pitfalls in Rust involves careful handling of ownership and borrowing, proper use of concurrency primitives, effective error handling with <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code>, understanding lifetimes, and managing module visibility. By being mindful of these areas and following best practices, developers can write reliable, safe, and idiomatic Rust code.
</p>

## 20.9. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By using the following guidelines, Rust programmers can effectively use composition to build flexible, maintainable, and efficient systems. The emphasis on safety, clarity, and performance in Rust's design philosophy supports these practices, leading to well-structured and resilient software.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Embrace Traits for Shared Behavior: </strong>In Rust, traits are the primary mechanism for defining shared behavior across different types. When designing your system, consider using traits to encapsulate common functionality. This allows for flexibility, as multiple structs can implement the same trait, thereby adhering to a common interface. Unlike inheritance in other languages, traits do not impose a specific data layout, promoting loose coupling and modularity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prefer Composition Over Inheritance: </strong>Rust does not support classical inheritance, and for good reason. Composition offers greater flexibility and clearer separation of concerns. By composing objects (structs) with other objects, you can build complex behaviors without the tight coupling that often accompanies inheritance hierarchies. This approach aligns with Rust's focus on safety and simplicity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Structs to Encapsulate State: </strong>Structs in Rust are excellent for encapsulating state and providing a well-defined interface for interacting with that state. When designing a system, define structs to represent the core data and use methods (implemented via traits or directly on the struct) to operate on that data. This encapsulation helps protect invariants and ensures that state can only be modified in controlled ways.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Leverage the Ownership System for Safety: </strong>Rust's ownership system is a powerful tool for ensuring memory safety and preventing data races. When using composition, carefully consider ownership and borrowing rules. For example, when one struct contains another, you must decide whether it owns the data (and thus has the right to modify or drop it) or simply borrows it temporarily. This clarity prevents common bugs and aligns with Rust's emphasis on safety.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Avoid Overusing Trait Objects: </strong>While trait objects (using <code>dyn Trait</code>) provide dynamic dispatch capabilities, they come with a runtime cost and can obscure the structure of your code. Use trait objects judiciously, primarily when the set of possible types is not known at compile time or when you need polymorphic behavior. When static dispatch (i.e., using generics) is possible and practical, it often offers better performance and more clarity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design for Flexibility and Extensibility: </strong>Composition inherently supports flexible and extensible designs. When composing behaviors, think about future changes and extensions. Design your traits and structs to be open for extension but closed for modification (the Open/Closed Principle). This means you can add new functionality or behaviors by creating new types or trait implementations without altering existing code.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Be Mindful of Performance Considerations:</strong> While composition provides design flexibility, it can also introduce performance considerations, especially when using trait objects or dynamic dispatch. Always consider the performance implications of your design choices, particularly in performance-critical systems. Rust's focus on zero-cost abstractions means you often don't pay for what you don't use, but understanding the trade-offs remains crucial.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use Documentation and Naming Conventions: </strong>Clear documentation and consistent naming conventions are essential in complex systems, particularly when using composition. Document the purpose of each struct and trait, the relationship between them, and the intended use cases. Good documentation helps others (and your future self) understand the design decisions and how to extend or modify the system.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Test and Validate Composition:</strong> Testing is crucial, especially when composing multiple behaviors. Ensure that each component behaves correctly in isolation and as part of the larger system. Use unit tests for individual structs and traits, and integration tests for testing the interplay between composed components. This thorough testing approach helps catch edge cases and integration issues.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reflect on Rustâ€™s Idioms and Best Practices: </strong>Rust has a unique set of idioms and best practices that often differ from other languages. Embrace these idioms, such as explicit error handling with <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code>, avoiding nulls, and preferring immutability. These idioms, combined with composition, can lead to robust and maintainable code that leverages Rust's strengths in safety and performance.</p>
