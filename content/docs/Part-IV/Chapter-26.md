## 26.1. Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Collections are a fundamental part of programming, providing a means to store, manage, and manipulate groups of values efficiently. In Rust, the standard library offers a rich set of collections to help developers manage data in various forms and structures. This chapter delves into the most commonly used collections in Rust, including vectors, strings, hash maps, BTree maps, and sets, as well as container adaptors like stacks, queues, and priority queues. Understanding these collections is essential for writing effective and idiomatic Rust code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust collections are designed to be safe and efficient, leveraging Rust's ownership and borrowing system to ensure memory safety and prevent data races. This introduction will provide an overview of why collections are important, the general characteristics of collections in Rust, and how they are represented internally. Collections in Rust can dynamically grow and shrink as needed, and they provide various ways to access and manipulate the data they contain. For instance, vectors (<code>Vec<T></code>) are one of the most commonly used collections due to their flexibility and ease of use. A vector can be created using the <code>vec!</code> macro, and elements can be added using the <code>push</code> method.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    v.push(4);
    println!("{:?}", v);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a vector is initialized with three elements, and then a fourth element is added. The <code>println!</code> macro is used to print the contents of the vector, demonstrating how vectors can dynamically grow.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Strings are another critical collection type, used to manage sequences of characters. Rust provides two primary string types: <code>String</code> and <code>&str</code>. A <code>String</code> is a growable, heap-allocated data structure, whereas <code>&str</code> is a string slice, representing a view into a string. Strings can be created and manipulated using various methods. For example, a <code>String</code> can be created from a string literal, and new strings can be appended using the <code>push_str</code> method.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("Hello");
    s.push_str(", world!");
    println!("{}", s);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, a <code>String</code> is created from the literal "Hello", and ", world!" is appended to it, resulting in the final string "Hello, world!".
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hash maps (<code>HashMap<K, V></code>) are associative containers that store key-value pairs, providing efficient methods for insertion, deletion, and lookup. They are useful for scenarios where fast retrieval of data based on a key is required. A hash map can be created using the <code>HashMap::new</code> method, and elements can be inserted using the <code>insert</code> method.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
    println!("{:?}", scores);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a hash map is created, and two key-value pairs are inserted. The contents of the hash map are then printed, showing the keys and their associated values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust collections also include more specialized types like <code>VecDeque</code> for double-ended queues, <code>LinkedList</code> for doubly linked lists, and <code>BinaryHeap</code> for priority queues. Each of these collections has unique characteristics and is optimized for different types of operations and use cases. For instance, a <code>VecDeque</code> allows for efficient addition and removal of elements from both ends of the queue.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    let mut deque = VecDeque::new();
    deque.push_back(1);
    deque.push_back(2);
    deque.push_front(0);
    println!("{:?}", deque);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, elements are added to both the front and back of a <code>VecDeque</code>, demonstrating its flexibility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This chapter will explore these collections in detail, discussing their internal representation, element requirements, and common operations. Through practical examples and comprehensive explanations, readers will gain a deep understanding of Rust's collections, enabling them to choose the right collection for their specific needs and use them effectively in their programs.
</p>

## 26.2. Container Overview
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Rust standard library offers a wide range of collection types that cater to different needs and use cases. These collections are designed to be efficient, safe, and ergonomic, taking advantage of Rustâ€™s ownership model to provide memory safety and concurrency guarantees. Collections in Rust include vectors, strings, hash maps, BTree maps, sets, and several specialized types like <code>VecDeque</code>, <code>LinkedList</code>, and <code>BinaryHeap</code>. Each type is optimized for specific scenarios, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate collection for their needs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Vectors (<code>Vec<T></code>) are one of the most commonly used collection types in Rust. They provide a dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size. Vectors are suitable for scenarios where you need a flexible array that supports fast, indexed access and allows elements to be added or removed. For example, you might use a vector to store a list of integers that you need to process.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    numbers.push(5);
    println!("{:?}", numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a vector is initialized with four integers, and a fifth integer is added using the <code>push</code> method. The vector is then printed, showing all five elements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Strings are another fundamental collection type in Rust. The <code>String</code> type is a growable, heap-allocated string, while <code>&str</code> represents a string slice, which is a view into a string. Strings are essential for handling text data, and Rust provides a rich set of methods for creating, modifying, and querying strings. For instance, you might use a <code>String</code> to store and manipulate a user's input.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut greeting = String::from("Hello");
    greeting.push_str(", world!");
    println!("{}", greeting); // Output: Hello, world!
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, a <code>String</code> is created from a string literal, and additional text is appended using the <code>push_str</code> method. The final string is then printed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hash maps (<code>HashMap<K, V></code>) are associative containers that store key-value pairs. They provide efficient methods for insertion, deletion, and lookup, making them ideal for scenarios where fast retrieval of values based on a key is required. For example, you might use a hash map to store and look up configuration settings by their names.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut settings = HashMap::new();
    settings.insert("resolution", "1920x1080");
    settings.insert("fullscreen", "true");
    println!("{:?}", settings); // Output: {"resolution": "1920x1080", "fullscreen": "true"}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a hash map is created and populated with two key-value pairs. The contents of the hash map are then printed, showing the settings and their corresponding values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
BTree maps (<code>BTreeMap<K, V></code>) and sets (<code>BTreeSet<T></code>) are ordered associative containers. Unlike hash maps, BTree maps maintain their elements in a sorted order, which can be beneficial for range queries and ordered traversal. For instance, you might use a <code>BTreeMap</code> to store and retrieve student scores in a sorted order.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = BTreeMap::new();
    scores.insert("Alice", 85);
    scores.insert("Bob", 90);
    scores.insert("Carol", 78);
    for (name, score) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", name, score);
    }
    // Output:
    // Alice: 85
    // Bob: 90
    // Carol: 78
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a BTree map is created and populated with student names and scores. The scores are then printed in alphabetical order of the student names.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Sets are another useful collection type, available as both <code>HashSet<T></code> and <code>BTreeSet<T></code>. Sets are used to store unique elements and provide fast membership testing. For example, you might use a set to keep track of unique tags associated with a blog post.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn main() {
    let mut tags = HashSet::new();
    tags.insert("rust");
    tags.insert("programming");
    tags.insert("tutorial");
    tags.insert("rust"); // Duplicate, will not be added
    println!("{:?}", tags); // Output: {"rust", "programming", "tutorial"}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a hash set is created and populated with three tags. Attempting to insert a duplicate tag has no effect, demonstrating the setâ€™s ability to maintain unique elements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to these fundamental collections, Rust provides specialized types like <code>VecDeque</code>, <code>LinkedList</code>, and <code>BinaryHeap</code>. <code>VecDeque</code> is a double-ended queue that allows for efficient additions and removals from both ends, making it suitable for implementing queues and deques.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    let mut deque = VecDeque::new();
    deque.push_back(1);
    deque.push_back(2);
    deque.push_front(0);
    println!("{:?}", deque); // Output: [0, 1, 2]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, elements are added to both the front and back of a <code>VecDeque</code>, demonstrating its flexibility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>LinkedList</code> is a doubly linked list, which allows for efficient insertions and deletions at any point in the list. However, linked lists have higher memory overhead and slower access times compared to vectors, so they are less commonly used.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::LinkedList;

fn main() {
    let mut list = LinkedList::new();
    list.push_back(1);
    list.push_back(2);
    list.push_front(0);
    println!("{:?}", list); // Output: [0, 1, 2]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, elements are added to both the front and back of a <code>LinkedList</code>, showing its ability to handle insertions at both ends.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>BinaryHeap</code> is a priority queue that always keeps the largest (or smallest) element at the top. This is useful for scenarios where you need to repeatedly access the highest priority element.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BinaryHeap;

fn main() {
    let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();
    heap.push(1);
    heap.push(5);
    heap.push(2);
    println!("{:?}", heap.peek()); // Output: Some(5)
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, elements are added to a <code>BinaryHeap</code>, and the highest priority element (the largest number) is accessed using the <code>peek</code> method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each of these collections has its own strengths and use cases, and understanding them allows developers to write more efficient and effective Rust code. This chapter will explore these collections in detail, providing comprehensive explanations and practical examples to help you make the most of Rustâ€™s powerful collection types.
</p>

## 26.3. Container Representation and Element Requirements
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Collections in Rust are designed to efficiently manage and manipulate groups of elements. The internal representation of these collections is crucial for understanding their performance characteristics and appropriate use cases. Rust collections, such as vectors, hash maps, and BTree maps, employ different internal structures to optimize for various operations like insertion, deletion, and access.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A vector (<code>Vec<T></code>) in Rust is implemented as a contiguous growable array. Internally, it consists of three main components: a pointer to the heap-allocated array, the current length of the vector, and the capacity of the allocated array. The capacity is the total amount of memory allocated for the vector, which can be larger than the current length to allow for growth without frequent reallocations. When elements are added to the vector and the capacity is exceeded, a new array with a larger capacity is allocated, and the existing elements are copied to this new array. This ensures that vectors provide amortized O(1) time complexity for push operations.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);
    vec.push(3);
    println!("{:?}", vec); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a vector is created and elements are pushed onto it. Internally, the vector reallocates memory to accommodate the new elements as needed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hash maps (<code>HashMap<K, V></code>) use a hash table for their internal representation. A hash table consists of an array of buckets, where each bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs that hash to the same value. To handle collisions, Rust's hash map uses a technique called "open addressing with quadratic probing" or "Robin Hood hashing." This approach ensures efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions by reducing clustering of elements in the hash table. The keyâ€™s hash value determines the index in the array where the key-value pair is stored. When a collision occurs, the algorithm probes subsequent indices until an empty bucket is found.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("key1", "value1");
    map.insert("key2", "value2");
    println!("{:?}", map); // Output: {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a hash map is created and key-value pairs are inserted. The internal hash table manages the storage and lookup of these pairs efficiently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
BTree maps (<code>BTreeMap<K, V></code>) are implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree. Specifically, Rust uses a B-tree, which is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. A B-tree maintains its elements in a sorted order and allows for efficient range queries. Each node in the B-tree contains multiple keys and child pointers, ensuring that the tree remains balanced with logarithmic depth. This structure allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, maintaining an O(log n) time complexity.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = BTreeMap::new();
    map.insert(1, "one");
    map.insert(2, "two");
    map.insert(3, "three");
    println!("{:?}", map); // Output: {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, a BTree map is created and elements are inserted. The map maintains the elements in sorted order, enabling efficient queries.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Regarding element requirements, Rust collections have certain constraints on the types of elements they can hold. These constraints ensure that operations on collections are safe and efficient. For instance, elements stored in a hash map must implement the <code>Eq</code> and <code>Hash</code> traits. The <code>Eq</code> trait ensures that elements can be compared for equality, while the <code>Hash</code> trait provides a hash function for the elements. This is necessary for the hash map to correctly manage key-value pairs and handle collisions.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Hash, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Key {
    id: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(Key { id: 1 }, "value1");
    map.insert(Key { id: 2 }, "value2");
    println!("{:?}", map); // Output: {Key { id: 1 }: "value1", Key { id: 2 }: "value2"}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a custom key type <code>Key</code> is defined, implementing the <code>Hash</code>, <code>Eq</code>, and <code>PartialEq</code> traits. This allows instances of <code>Key</code> to be used as keys in a hash map.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similarly, elements in a BTree map must implement the <code>Ord</code> trait, which allows the elements to be ordered. This requirement is necessary for the B-tree to maintain its sorted structure and support efficient range queries.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

#[derive(Ord, PartialOrd, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Key {
    id: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut map = BTreeMap::new();
    map.insert(Key { id: 1 }, "one");
    map.insert(Key { id: 2 }, "two");
    println!("{:?}", map); // Output: {Key { id: 1 }: "one", Key { id: 2 }: "two"}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the <code>Key</code> type implements the <code>Ord</code>, <code>PartialOrd</code>, <code>Eq</code>, and <code>PartialEq</code> traits, making it suitable for use as a key in a BTree map.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By understanding the internal representation of Rust collections and the requirements for their elements, developers can choose the appropriate collection for their specific needs and ensure that their code is both efficient and safe. Rustâ€™s standard library collections leverage the languageâ€™s ownership and borrowing system to provide powerful and flexible data structures that are crucial for effective Rust programming.
</p>

## 26.4. Operations Overview
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Operations on collections in Rust encompass a wide range of functionalities that allow developers to manipulate and interact with data stored within vectors, hash maps, BTree maps, and other collection types efficiently. Understanding these operations is essential for utilizing Rust's collections effectively in various applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Member Types, Constructors, Destructor, and Assignments<strong></strong>: Each collection type in Rust defines specific member types, constructors, destructors, and assignment behaviors that govern how instances of the collection are created, modified, and destroyed. For instance, vectors (<code>Vec<T></code>) have methods like <code>new()</code> to create an empty vector and <code>with_capacity(capacity: usize)</code> to pre-allocate memory for a vector, optimizing performance when elements are added.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    // Creating a new vector
    let mut vec1: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

    // Creating a vector with initial elements and capacity
    let mut vec2 = Vec::with_capacity(10);

    // Adding elements to vectors
    vec1.push(1);
    vec2.push(2);

    println!("{:?}", vec1); // Output: [1]
    println!("{:?}", vec2); // Output: [2]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, two vectors (<code>vec1</code> and <code>vec2</code>) are created using different constructors. Elements are added to each vector using the <code>push()</code> method, demonstrating the flexibility and initialization options available for vectors in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Size and Capacity<strong></strong>: Collections in Rust maintain information about their size (the number of elements currently stored) and capacity (the total amount of space allocated for storage). This distinction is crucial for understanding how collections manage memory and optimize performance. For instance, vectors dynamically adjust their capacity as elements are added or removed to minimize reallocations and improve efficiency.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();

    // Checking initial size and capacity
    println!("Initial size: {}", vec.len()); // Output: 0
    println!("Initial capacity: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: 0

    // Adding elements to vector
    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);

    // Checking updated size and capacity
    println!("Updated size: {}", vec.len()); // Output: 2
    println!("Updated capacity: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: 2
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a vector <code>vec</code> is created initially with zero elements. Elements are added using <code>push()</code>, and the <code>len()</code> and <code>capacity()</code> methods are used to query the size and capacity of the vector at different points, illustrating how vectors manage memory dynamically.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Iterators<strong></strong>: Iterators provide a powerful mechanism for traversing and operating on elements stored within collections in Rust. Collections like vectors and hash maps implement iterator traits (<code>IntoIterator</code> and <code>Iterator</code>) that enable seamless iteration over their elements. Iterators can be used with loops, functional programming constructs like <code>map()</code> and <code>filter()</code>, and other operations that require sequential access to collection elements.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Using iterator to print each element
    for num in vec.iter() {
        println!("{}", num);
    }

    // Using iterator with map() to transform elements
    let doubled: Vec<i32> = vec.iter().map(|&x| x * 2).collect();
    println!("{:?}", doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a vector <code>vec</code> is created with initial elements. The <code>iter()</code> method is used to obtain an iterator over the vector's elements, demonstrating iteration and transformation (<code>map()</code>) operations that can be performed using iterators.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Element Access<strong></strong>: Rust collections provide methods for accessing elements by index, key, or position within the collection. Vectors and arrays support indexed access (<code>vec[index]</code>), while hash maps and BTree maps allow access by key (<code>map.get(key)</code>). Efficient element access is crucial for performance-sensitive applications where rapid retrieval of data is necessary.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    // Creating a hash map
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert("Alice", 95);
    scores.insert("Bob", 85);

    // Accessing elements by key
    if let Some(score) = scores.get("Alice") {
        println!("Alice's score: {}", score); // Output: Alice's score: 95
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a hash map <code>scores</code> is created with key-value pairs representing scores. The <code>get()</code> method is used to access Alice's score by key, demonstrating efficient lookup and retrieval of data from a hash map.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Stack Operations, List Operations, and Other Operations<strong></strong>: Different collection types support specific operations tailored to their characteristics. For instance, stack operations like <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> are supported by <code>VecDeque</code> for double-ended queues, enabling efficient additions and removals from both ends of the queue. Similarly, linked lists (<code>LinkedList</code>) support operations like <code>push_back()</code> and <code>pop_front()</code> for efficient insertions and deletions at various positions.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    // Creating a deque
    let mut deque = VecDeque::new();

    // Pushing elements to the front and back
    deque.push_back(1);
    deque.push_back(2);
    deque.push_front(0);

    // Popping elements from the front
    while let Some(front) = deque.pop_front() {
        println!("Front element: {}", front);
    }
    // Output:
    // Front element: 0
    // Front element: 1
    // Front element: 2
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, a <code>VecDeque</code> <code>deque</code> is created, and elements are added to both ends using <code>push_back()</code> and <code>push_front()</code>. The <code>pop_front()</code> method is then used to sequentially remove and print elements from the front of the deque, illustrating stack-like behavior with double-ended queue operations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Operations overview in Rust collections provides developers with powerful tools to manage and manipulate data efficiently. By leveraging constructors, iterators, efficient access methods, and specialized operations, developers can optimize their use of Rust's collections to meet the requirements of diverse application scenarios effectively. Understanding these operations is fundamental to writing robust and performant Rust code that leverages the strengths of its collections.
</p>

## 26.5. Member Types
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Member types in Rust collections refer to the various types that collections define to facilitate their functionality. These types include iterators, keys, values, and entry types, which allow for a range of operations such as traversal, access, and mutation of elements. Understanding these member types is essential for effectively using Rustâ€™s collections in different scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the primary member types in Rust collections is the iterator. Iterators provide a way to sequentially access elements in a collection. For example, the <code>Vec<T></code> type defines an <code>Iterator</code> that allows for iterating over its elements. The <code>iter()</code>, <code>iter_mut()</code>, and <code>into_iter()</code> methods return different kinds of iterators, each with specific capabilities. The <code>iter()</code> method returns an iterator that yields references to the elements, <code>iter_mut()</code> returns an iterator that yields mutable references, and <code>into_iter()</code> consumes the collection and returns an iterator that yields the elements by value.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Immutable iteration
    for &num in vec.iter() {
        println!("Immutable iteration: {}", num);
    }

    // Mutable iteration
    let mut vec_mut = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for num in vec_mut.iter_mut() {
        *num *= 2;
    }
    println!("After mutable iteration: {:?}", vec_mut);

    // Ownership iteration
    let vec_owned = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for num in vec_owned.into_iter() {
        println!("Ownership iteration: {}", num);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, three types of iteration are demonstrated using a vector. The immutable iteration with <code>iter()</code>, mutable iteration with <code>iter_mut()</code>, and ownership iteration with <code>into_iter()</code> showcase the flexibility provided by iterators in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For associative collections like <code>HashMap<K, V></code> and <code>BTreeMap<K, V></code>, there are additional member types related to keys and values. The <code>HashMap</code> and <code>BTreeMap</code> define types like <code>Keys</code>, <code>Values</code>, and <code>Entries</code>. The <code>keys()</code> method returns an iterator over the keys, <code>values()</code> returns an iterator over the values, and <code>entries()</code> returns an iterator over the key-value pairs.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("key1", "value1");
    map.insert("key2", "value2");

    // Iterating over keys
    for key in map.keys() {
        println!("Key: {}", key);
    }

    // Iterating over values
    for value in map.values() {
        println!("Value: {}", value);
    }

    // Iterating over key-value pairs
    for (key, value) in map.iter() {
        println!("Key: {}, Value: {}", key, value);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a <code>HashMap</code> is used to demonstrate the iteration over keys, values, and key-value pairs. These member types provide efficient access to different parts of the collection, enhancing the versatility of operations on associative collections.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another important member type is the entry. The <code>Entry</code> API in collections like <code>HashMap</code> and <code>BTreeMap</code> allows for efficient manipulation of individual elements based on their keys. The <code>entry()</code> method provides a view into a single entry in the map, which can be either an existing entry or a vacant one. This API enables operations like insertion, modification, or removal of elements based on their presence or absence in the collection.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("key1", 1);

    // Using entry API to insert or update values
    map.entry("key1").and_modify(|v| *v += 1).or_insert(0);
    map.entry("key2").and_modify(|v| *v += 1).or_insert(2);

    println!("{:?}", map); // Output: {"key1": 2, "key2": 2}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Entry</code> API is used to modify the values associated with keys in a <code>HashMap</code>. For <code>key1</code>, the value is incremented if it exists, and for <code>key2</code>, a new value is inserted because it does not exist. The <code>entry()</code> method thus provides a powerful and flexible way to manipulate elements within a collection based on their keys.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to these specific member types, Rust collections also define associated types within their iterator implementations. For instance, the <code>Iterator</code> trait itself has an associated type <code>Item</code> that represents the type of elements yielded by the iterator. This associated type is essential for defining the behavior of iterators across different collection types.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Member types in Rust collections are fundamental to their design and functionality. They provide a range of operations that facilitate efficient and flexible manipulation of collection elements. By leveraging iterators, keys, values, and entry APIs, developers can harness the full power of Rustâ€™s collections to implement robust and performant data structures in their applications.
</p>

## 26.6. Constructors, Destructor, and Assignments
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Constructors, destructors, and assignments are fundamental operations for managing the lifecycle of collections in Rust. These operations encompass creating and initializing collections, handling their destruction and cleanup, and managing assignments and copying.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Creating and Initializing Collections<strong></strong>: Collections in Rust provide various constructors to create and initialize instances. For example, the <code>Vec<T></code> collection can be created using the <code>new</code> method, which initializes an empty vector, or the <code>with_capacity</code> method, which initializes a vector with a specified capacity. Here is an example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    // Creating an empty vector
    let mut vec1: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

    // Creating a vector with a specified capacity
    let mut vec2 = Vec::with_capacity(10);

    // Adding elements to the vectors
    vec1.push(1);
    vec2.push(2);

    println!("{:?}", vec1); // Output: [1]
    println!("{:?}", vec2); // Output: [2]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>vec1</code> is created as an empty vector, and <code>vec2</code> is created with an initial capacity of 10. Elements are then added to both vectors using the <code>push</code> method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Other collections, such as <code>HashMap<K, V></code>, also provide similar constructors. The <code>new</code> method creates an empty hash map, while the <code>with_capacity</code> method creates a hash map with a specified capacity:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    // Creating an empty hash map
    let mut scores: HashMap<&str, i32> = HashMap::new();

    // Creating a hash map with a specified capacity
    let mut scores_with_capacity = HashMap::with_capacity(10);

    // Adding elements to the hash maps
    scores.insert("Alice", 10);
    scores_with_capacity.insert("Bob", 20);

    println!("{:?}", scores); // Output: {"Alice": 10}
    println!("{:?}", scores_with_capacity); // Output: {"Bob": 20}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>scores</code> is created as an empty hash map, and <code>scores_with_capacity</code> is created with an initial capacity of 10. Elements are then added to both hash maps using the <code>insert</code> method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Destruction and Cleanup<strong></strong>: Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that collections are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope. This automatic cleanup is achieved through Rust's implementation of the <code>Drop</code> trait for collections. When a collection goes out of scope, its <code>drop</code> method is called, releasing any resources it holds.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, when a <code>Vec<T></code> goes out of scope, its memory is automatically deallocated, and any resources it holds are cleaned up:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    {
        let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
        // vec is in scope here
    }
    // vec goes out of scope here, and its memory is deallocated
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the vector <code>vec</code> goes out of scope at the end of the block, and its memory is automatically deallocated. This ensures efficient memory management without requiring explicit cleanup code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Assignment and Copying<strong></strong>: Assignment and copying in Rust are managed through ownership and borrowing semantics. By default, assigning one collection to another moves ownership, meaning the original collection can no longer be used after the assignment. This behavior ensures that there is only one owner of the data at any time, preventing issues like double-free errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, when a vector is assigned to another variable, ownership is transferred:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec1; // Ownership of vec1 is moved to vec2

    // vec1 can no longer be used here
    // println!("{:?}", vec1); // This line would cause a compile-time error
    println!("{:?}", vec2); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>vec1</code> is moved to <code>vec2</code>, and <code>vec1</code> can no longer be used after the move. This ownership transfer prevents accidental use of <code>vec1</code> after it has been moved.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust collections also support cloning, which allows for creating a deep copy of the collection. The <code>clone</code> method creates a new instance of the collection with the same elements, duplicating the data:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec1.clone(); // Creates a deep copy of vec1

    println!("{:?}", vec1); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
    println!("{:?}", vec2); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>vec1</code> is cloned to <code>vec2</code>, creating a deep copy of the vector. Both <code>vec1</code> and <code>vec2</code> can be used independently without affecting each other.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding the constructors, destructors, and assignment operations for collections in Rust is crucial for effective memory management and efficient code. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, combined with its powerful collection APIs, provides a robust framework for creating, initializing, and managing collections with ease, ensuring both safety and performance.
</p>

## 26.7. Size and Capacity
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding and managing the size and capacity of collections in Rust is fundamental to writing efficient and performant code. The concepts of size and capacity relate to how collections grow, shrink, and manage their allocated memory.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Understanding Collection Size<strong></strong>: The size of a collection refers to the number of elements it currently holds. In Rust, most collections provide a method to retrieve their size, typically named <code>len</code>. For example, the <code>Vec<T></code> collection has a <code>len</code> method that returns the number of elements in the vector:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("Size of the vector: {}", vec.len()); // Output: Size of the vector: 5
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the vector <code>vec</code> contains five elements, so <code>vec.len()</code> returns 5. The <code>len</code> method is an essential tool for querying the size of a collection, allowing you to understand how many elements are present at any given time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong></strong>Managing and Optimizing Capacity<strong></strong>: Capacity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory allocated for a collection, which might be more than the number of elements it currently holds. Collections in Rust typically allocate more memory than necessary to avoid frequent reallocations as they grow. The <code>capacity</code> method can be used to retrieve the current capacity of a collection. For instance, <code>Vec<T></code> provides a <code>capacity</code> method:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(10);
    println!("Initial capacity: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: Initial capacity: 10

    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);
    println!("Capacity after adding elements: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: Capacity after adding elements: 10
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the vector <code>vec</code> is created with an initial capacity of 10, meaning it can hold up to 10 elements without needing to reallocate memory. The <code>capacity</code> method confirms this initial allocation. Even after adding two elements, the capacity remains the same because the number of elements is still within the allocated capacity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust collections manage their capacity dynamically. When a collection exceeds its current capacity, it reallocates memory to accommodate more elements. This reallocation usually involves doubling the capacity to amortize the cost of growing the collection. However, this can result in unused allocated memory if the collection does not grow further. To optimize memory usage, Rust provides methods to shrink the capacity to match the size of the collection. For <code>Vec<T></code>, the <code>shrink_to_fit</code> method can be used to reduce the capacity to the minimum required:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(10);
    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);
    println!("Capacity before shrinking: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: Capacity before shrinking: 10

    vec.shrink_to_fit();
    println!("Capacity after shrinking: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: Capacity after shrinking: 2
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the vector <code>vec</code> is initially created with a capacity of 10. After adding two elements, the <code>shrink_to_fit</code> method reduces the capacity to 2, matching the number of elements and freeing up unused memory.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another important aspect of managing capacity is reserving space in advance. Reserving capacity can improve performance by reducing the number of reallocations needed as a collection grows. The <code>reserve</code> method allows you to specify the additional capacity needed. For instance, if you anticipate adding a significant number of elements to a vector, you can reserve the required capacity upfront:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.reserve(10);
    println!("Capacity after reserving: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: Capacity after reserving: 10

    for i in 0..10 {
        vec.push(i);
    }
    println!("Capacity after adding elements: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: Capacity after adding elements: 10
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the vector <code>vec</code> is created without any initial capacity. The <code>reserve</code> method is then used to allocate space for 10 elements. As elements are added, the capacity remains sufficient, avoiding any additional reallocations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding the size and capacity of collections in Rust is crucial for writing efficient code. The size provides information about the number of elements, while the capacity relates to the allocated memory. Managing capacity through methods like <code>shrink_to_fit</code> and <code>reserve</code> allows for optimizing memory usage and improving performance. Rust's collections provide powerful tools for controlling size and capacity, ensuring both efficiency and flexibility in handling data. By leveraging these tools, developers can create robust and performant applications that make the best use of available resources.
</p>

## 26.8. Iterators
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Iterators are a fundamental concept in Rust, providing a powerful and flexible way to traverse and manipulate collections. They allow for a clean, concise, and efficient method of processing sequences of elements. Understanding how to iterate over collections and the common patterns associated with iterators is crucial for effective Rust programming.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, iterators are implemented through the <code>Iterator</code> trait, which defines a sequence of elements that can be iterated over. Most collections in Rust provide methods to create iterators, enabling iteration over their elements. For instance, the <code>Vec<T></code> collection has methods like <code>iter</code>, <code>iter_mut</code>, and <code>into_iter</code> to create different types of iterators.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>iter</code> method creates an immutable iterator that allows you to borrow each element of the collection in sequence without modifying the collection. Here is an example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for val in vec.iter() {
        println!("{}", val); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>iter</code> method creates an iterator over the vector <code>vec</code>, and the <code>for</code> loop iterates over each element, printing it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>iter_mut</code> method creates a mutable iterator, allowing you to modify each element of the collection as you iterate over it:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for val in vec.iter_mut() {
        *val *= 2;
    }
    println!("{:?}", vec); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>iter_mut</code> method creates a mutable iterator, and each element of the vector is doubled during iteration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>into_iter</code> method consumes the collection and creates an iterator that takes ownership of each element, allowing you to move or process each element without borrowing:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for val in vec.into_iter() {
        println!("{}", val); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    }
    // vec is no longer accessible here as it has been consumed
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>into_iter</code> method creates an iterator that consumes the vector <code>vec</code>, and each element is printed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Iterators in Rust support a variety of powerful patterns that can simplify common tasks and improve code readability. One such pattern is the use of combinators, which are methods provided by the <code>Iterator</code> trait to transform and process elements in a functional style.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A common combinator is <code>map</code>, which applies a function to each element and returns a new iterator with the results:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let doubled: Vec<i32> = vec.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
    println!("{:?}", doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>map</code> combinator doubles each element of the vector, and the <code>collect</code> method gathers the results into a new vector.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another useful combinator is <code>filter</code>, which creates an iterator that only yields elements matching a predicate:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    // `filter` closure needs to handle `&i32` references correctly
    let even: Vec<i32> = vec.iter().filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0).cloned().collect();
    println!("{:?}", even); // Output: [2, 4]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>filter</code> combinator selects only the even elements of the vector, and the <code>collect</code> method gathers them into a new vector.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>fold</code> combinator is another powerful tool, allowing you to reduce an iterator to a single value by repeatedly applying a function:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let sum: i32 = vec.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);
    println!("Sum: {}", sum); // Output: Sum: 15
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>fold</code> combinator computes the sum of all elements in the vector by starting with an initial value of 0 and repeatedly adding each element.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust also supports iterator chaining, allowing you to combine multiple combinators to perform complex transformations concisely:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let result: Vec<i32> = vec.iter()
                              .filter(|&&x| x % 2 != 0)
                              .map(|&x| x * 2)
                              .collect();
    println!("{:?}", result); // Output: [2, 6, 10]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the vector is first filtered to keep only odd elements, then each remaining element is doubled, and finally, the results are collected into a new vector.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Iterators in Rust provide a powerful and expressive way to work with collections. By understanding how to create and use iterators, and by leveraging common iterator patterns, you can write concise, efficient, and readable code for processing sequences of elements. The flexibility of iterators and the rich set of combinators available in Rust make them an essential tool for any Rust programmer.
</p>

## 26.9. Element Access
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Accessing elements in collections is a fundamental operation in Rust programming, and different types of collections provide various methods for retrieving their elements. Understanding how to access elements efficiently and safely is crucial for effective data manipulation and retrieval.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, a <code>Vec<T></code> is a dynamically-sized array that provides efficient indexing. You can access elements in a vector using indexing or by iterating over it. The indexing syntax, <code>vec[index]</code>, allows you to retrieve an element directly if the index is within bounds. If the index is out of bounds, it will panic at runtime. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let third_element = vec[2];
    println!("The third element is: {}", third_element); // Output: 30
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, accessing <code>vec[2]</code> retrieves the element at index 2, which is <code>30</code>. This method is straightforward but lacks bounds checking. For safer access, you can use the <code>get</code> method, which returns an <code>Option</code> type:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    match vec.get(2) {
        Some(&value) => println!("The third element is: {}", value),
        None => println!("Index out of bounds"),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>vec.get(2)</code> returns <code>Some(&30)</code> if the index is valid, or <code>None</code> if it's out of bounds, providing a safer way to handle potential errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A <code>HashMap<K, V></code> in Rust provides a key-value mapping where elements are accessed via keys. To retrieve a value, you use the <code>get</code> method with the key. This method returns an <code>Option</code> type, which helps handle cases where the key might not be present:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("apple", 3);
    map.insert("banana", 2);
    
    if let Some(&count) = map.get("apple") {
        println!("Apple count: {}", count); // Output: Apple count: 3
    } else {
        println!("Apple not found");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>map.get("apple")</code> returns <code>Some(&3)</code> if "apple" exists in the map, or <code>None</code> if it does not. This allows for safe and controlled access to the mapâ€™s values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For a <code>HashSet<T></code>, which stores unique elements, access is slightly different since <code>HashSet</code> does not support direct indexing. Instead, you can check for the presence of an element using the <code>contains</code> method and then retrieve it using iteration if needed:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn main() {
    let mut set = HashSet::new();
    set.insert("red");
    set.insert("green");
    set.insert("blue");
    
    if set.contains("green") {
        println!("Green is in the set");
    } else {
        println!("Green is not in the set");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>set.contains("green")</code> checks if "green" is an element of the <code>HashSet</code>. While you cannot directly access elements by index, <code>contains</code> helps verify the presence of an element.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>BTreeMap<K, V></code> and <code>BTreeSet<T></code> are ordered collections that provide access based on sorted keys or values. For <code>BTreeMap</code>, you use the <code>get</code> method similar to <code>HashMap</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = BTreeMap::new();
    map.insert("apple", 3);
    map.insert("banana", 2);
    
    if let Some(&count) = map.get("banana") {
        println!("Banana count: {}", count); // Output: Banana count: 2
    } else {
        println!("Banana not found");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>map.get("banana")</code> behaves like in <code>HashMap</code>, but the <code>BTreeMap</code> maintains its keys in sorted order, which can be useful for ordered operations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For <code>BTreeSet</code>, which is a set with elements stored in a sorted order, you typically use methods like <code>contains</code> to check for presence:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

fn main() {
    let mut set = BTreeSet::new();
    set.insert(10);
    set.insert(20);
    set.insert(30);
    
    if set.contains(&20) {
        println!("20 is in the set");
    } else {
        println!("20 is not in the set");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case, <code>set.contains(&20)</code> checks if the number 20 is in the <code>BTreeSet</code>, which helps in scenarios where ordering is important.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding how to access elements in various collections effectively helps you write more efficient and robust Rust code. Each collection type offers different methods and considerations, so choosing the right approach for element access can impact the performance and safety of your code.
</p>

## 26.10. Stack Operations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, stack-like operations, such as Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior, are crucial in various applications, including algorithm design and data management. Stack operations are primarily implemented using collections that inherently support LIFO behavior, and in Rust, the <code>Vec</code> type is often used for this purpose due to its efficient push and pop operations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A stack is a data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, typically referred to as the top of the stack. The primary operations for a stack are <code>push</code> (to add an element) and <code>pop</code> (to remove the most recently added element). In Rust, <code>Vec<T></code> can be used to emulate stack behavior due to its dynamic resizing and ability to efficiently handle elements at the end of the collection.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To demonstrate stack operations, consider the following Rust code that uses a <code>Vec</code> to implement a stack:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut stack = Vec::new(); // Create a new empty vector to use as a stack
    
    // Push elements onto the stack
    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);
    stack.push(4);
    
    println!("Stack after pushes: {:?}", stack); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    // Pop elements from the stack
    if let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
        println!("Popped element: {}", top); // Output: 4
    }
    
    println!("Stack after pop: {:?}", stack); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
    
    // Peek at the top element without removing it
    if let Some(&top) = stack.last() {
        println!("Top element: {}", top); // Output: 3
    }
    
    println!("Stack after peek: {:?}", stack); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Vec::new()</code> initializes an empty vector that will be used as a stack. The <code>push</code> method is used to add elements to the top of the stack, effectively increasing its size. After pushing elements, the stack contains <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>pop</code> method removes the most recently added element, which is <code>4</code> in this case, and reduces the stack size to <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>. The <code>pop</code> method returns an <code>Option<T></code>, which is <code>Some(top)</code> if the stack is not empty, or <code>None</code> if it is empty. This ensures safe handling of empty stacks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To look at the top element of the stack without modifying it, the <code>last</code> method is used. This method returns a reference to the last element, which corresponds to the top of the stack, allowing inspection without removal. In this example, <code>stack.last()</code> returns a reference to <code>3</code>, which is the current top of the stack.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The stack operations demonstrated here are efficient because <code>Vec</code> provides constant-time complexity for <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, and <code>last</code> operations. This makes it an excellent choice for implementing stack behavior in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For more specialized stack needs, Rust also provides the <code>std::collections::VecDeque</code> type, which supports efficient insertions and deletions from both ends. While <code>VecDeque</code> can be used for stack-like operations by adding and removing elements from one end, its primary use is for deque (double-ended queue) operations where elements are added or removed from both the front and back.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Stack operations with <code>Vec</code> in Rust are straightforward and efficient, leveraging the dynamic nature of vectors to provide LIFO behavior. By understanding and using these operations, you can manage data in a stack-like manner effectively, benefiting from Rustâ€™s strong type system and safety guarantees.
</p>

## 26.11. List Operations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, lists are dynamic collections of elements that can be efficiently manipulated and accessed. The <code>Vec<T></code> type serves as a versatile implementation of a list, providing a variety of operations to handle elements efficiently. While Rust does not have a dedicated linked list type in its standard library, the <code>Vec<T></code> type offers many list-specific operations that are commonly used in list data structures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key operations in list management is inserting and removing elements. In a <code>Vec<T></code>, you can insert elements at a specific position using the <code>insert</code> method. This method shifts existing elements to the right to accommodate the new element, making it suitable for cases where order matters and modifications are needed. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    list.insert(2, 10); // Insert 10 at index 2
    println!("List after insertion: {:?}", list); // Output: [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>insert(2, 10)</code> places the value <code>10</code> at index <code>2</code>, shifting the existing elements from index <code>2</code> onwards to the right. The resulting list is <code>[1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5]</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Removing elements from a <code>Vec<T></code> can be achieved using the <code>remove</code> method, which removes the element at a specified index and returns it. This method also shifts the remaining elements left to fill the gap. Consider the following example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let removed = list.remove(2); // Remove element at index 2
    println!("Removed element: {}", removed); // Output: 3
    println!("List after removal: {:?}", list); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case, <code>remove(2)</code> removes the element <code>3</code> from index <code>2</code>, resulting in the list <code>[1, 2, 4, 5]</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Accessing elements in a list is typically done using indexing or iterators. Indexing into a <code>Vec<T></code> retrieves an element at a specific position, while iterators provide a way to traverse and manipulate each element. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let list = vec![10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let second = list[1];
    println!("The second element is: {}", second); // Output: 20
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>list[1]</code> accesses the element at index <code>1</code>, which is <code>20</code>. This method requires that the index is within bounds, or else it will panic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Iteration over a <code>Vec<T></code> is straightforward with the <code>iter</code> method, which returns an iterator that yields references to the elements. You can use this iterator in a loop to perform operations on each element:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let list = vec![10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    for value in list.iter() {
        println!("{}", value); // Outputs: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This code snippet uses a <code>for</code> loop to iterate over the list, printing each element.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust allows slicing of vectors to work with a subset of elements. A slice is a view into a contiguous sequence of elements in a <code>Vec<T></code>. Slicing is performed using the syntax <code>vec[start..end]</code>, which creates a slice from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> (excluding <code>end</code>):
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let list = vec![10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let slice = &list[1..4];
    println!("Slice: {:?}", slice); // Output: [20, 30, 40]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>&list[1..4]</code> creates a slice containing elements from index <code>1</code> to <code>3</code>, resulting in <code>[20, 30, 40]</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Operations like reversing and sorting are also supported in <code>Vec<T></code>. Reversing a vector rearranges its elements in the opposite order, while sorting arranges them in a specific order. The <code>reverse</code> and <code>sort</code> methods are used for these operations:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![10, 30, 20, 50, 40];
    list.reverse();
    println!("Reversed list: {:?}", list); // Output: [40, 50, 20, 30, 10]
    
    list.sort();
    println!("Sorted list: {:?}", list); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>reverse()</code> rearranges the elements in reverse order, and <code>sort()</code> arranges them in ascending order.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Overall, <code>Vec<T></code> in Rust provides a rich set of list-specific operations that enable efficient manipulation and access of elements. By leveraging these operations, you can perform a wide range of tasks involving dynamic collections, making <code>Vec<T></code> a powerful tool for managing lists in Rust programs.
</p>

## 26.12. Other Operations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to the fundamental operations provided by Rustâ€™s collections, there are several other methods and functionalities that enhance the versatility and usability of these collections. These additional operations include transformations, searching, and other utility methods that allow for more complex data manipulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust collections provide methods for transforming elements in a collection. For instance, the <code>map</code> method on an iterator allows you to apply a function to each element and produce a new iterator of the transformed elements. Consider the following example where we use <code>map</code> to square each element in a vector:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let squared: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|&x| x * x).collect();
    println!("Squared numbers: {:?}", squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>numbers.iter().map(|&x| x * x)</code> creates an iterator that squares each element of the vector, and <code>collect()</code> gathers these squared values into a new <code>Vec<i32></code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>filter</code> method allows you to create a new iterator that only includes elements satisfying a specific condition. This method is particularly useful for narrowing down elements based on custom criteria. Hereâ€™s an example where we filter out even numbers from a vector:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    let evens: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().filter(|&&x| x % 2 == 0).cloned().collect();
    println!("Even numbers: {:?}", evens); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case, <code>filter(|&&x| x % 2 == 0)</code> creates an iterator that only includes even numbers. The <code>cloned()</code> method is used to convert the references to values before collecting them into a new vector.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Searching operations allow you to find elements in a collection based on specific criteria. For instance, the <code>find</code> method on iterators can be used to locate the first element that matches a given predicate. Here is an example where we find the first element greater than 3 in a vector:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    if let Some(&found) = numbers.iter().find(|&&x| x > 3) {
        println!("First number greater than 3: {}", found); // Output: 4
    } else {
        println!("No number greater than 3 found");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>find(|&&x| x > 3)</code> method returns an <code>Option</code> containing the first element greater than 3, or <code>None</code> if no such element is found.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Aggregation operations like <code>sum</code>, <code>product</code>, and <code>fold</code> are useful for combining elements into a single value. For example, to compute the sum of all elements in a vector, you can use the <code>sum</code> method:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let total: i32 = numbers.iter().sum();
    println!("Sum of numbers: {}", total); // Output: 15
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>numbers.iter().sum()</code> calculates the total sum of the elements in the vector.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>sort</code> method organizes elements in a specific order. For sorting in ascending order, the <code>sort</code> method is straightforward, but you can also use <code>sort_by</code> to define custom sorting logic. Hereâ€™s an example of sorting in descending order:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = vec![10, 5, 8, 2, 7];
    numbers.sort_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); // Sorting in descending order
    println!("Sorted in descending order: {:?}", numbers); // Output: [10, 8, 7, 5, 2]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To reverse the order of elements, you can use the <code>reverse</code> method, which reverses the elements in place:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    numbers.reverse();
    println!("Reversed numbers: {:?}", numbers); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust collections also support concatenation, particularly with vectors. You can concatenate two vectors using the <code>extend</code> method or the <code>append</code> method. Here is an example using <code>extend</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut list1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let list2 = vec![4, 5, 6];
    list1.extend(list2);
    println!("Concatenated list: {:?}", list1); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>extend</code> appends the elements of <code>list2</code> to <code>list1</code>, resulting in a concatenated list.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s collections also include utility methods such as <code>is_empty</code>, <code>len</code>, and <code>capacity</code> to inspect the state of a collection. For instance, <code>is_empty</code> checks if a collection is empty:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    if numbers.is_empty() {
        println!("The vector is empty");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These additional operations and methods for collections in Rust greatly enhance their functionality, allowing for complex data manipulation and retrieval. Whether you are transforming, filtering, searching, aggregating, sorting, or concatenating, Rust provides powerful tools to handle collections effectively and safely.
</p>

## 26.13. Containers
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s standard library offers several fundamental container types, each serving different purposes and use cases. These containers are designed to manage collections of elements efficiently while providing various functionalities tailored to different requirements. The primary container types include vectors, lists, and associative containers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>Vec<T></code> type is perhaps the most commonly used container in Rust. It represents a growable array and provides fast, indexed access to its elements. Vectors are dynamically sized, meaning they can grow and shrink as needed. This makes them highly versatile for scenarios where you need a flexible array-like structure. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(10);
    vec.push(20);
    vec.push(30);
    
    println!("Vector: {:?}", vec); // Output: Vector: [10, 20, 30]
    
    vec.pop();
    println!("Vector after pop: {:?}", vec); // Output: Vector after pop: [10, 20]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Vec::new()</code> creates an empty vector, and <code>push</code> adds elements to it. The <code>pop</code> method removes the last element. Vectors are suitable for situations where you need a contiguous block of memory with efficient indexing and modification capabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust does not include a built-in linked list type in the standard library, but it does provide a <code>LinkedList<T></code> container in the <code>std::collections</code> module. The <code>LinkedList<T></code> type represents a doubly linked list, which allows for efficient insertions and removals at both ends of the list. This makes it useful for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required. Consider the following example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::LinkedList;

fn main() {
    let mut list = LinkedList::new();
    list.push_back(1);
    list.push_back(2);
    list.push_front(0);
    
    println!("LinkedList: {:?}", list); // Output: LinkedList: [0, 1, 2]
    
    list.pop_back();
    println!("LinkedList after pop_back: {:?}", list); // Output: LinkedList after pop_back: [0, 1]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>LinkedList::new()</code> creates an empty linked list. <code>push_back</code> adds elements to the end, and <code>push_front</code> adds elements to the beginning. <code>pop_back</code> removes the last element. Linked lists are ideal for scenarios where you need to frequently insert or remove elements at arbitrary positions, but they do not provide the same level of efficient indexing as vectors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust provides several associative containers in the <code>std::collections</code> module, which allow for storing key-value pairs. The most commonly used associative containers are <code>HashMap</code> and <code>BTreeMap</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>HashMap<K, V></code> type is a hash table-based map that provides fast insertion, deletion, and lookup of key-value pairs. It is suitable for scenarios where you need efficient access to values based on keys and the order of elements is not important. Here is an example of using <code>HashMap</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("name", "Alice");
    map.insert("age", "30");
    
    println!("HashMap: {:?}", map); // Output: HashMap: {"name": "Alice", "age": "30"}
    
    if let Some(name) = map.get("name") {
        println!("Name: {}", name); // Output: Name: Alice
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>HashMap::new()</code> creates an empty hash map, and <code>insert</code> adds key-value pairs. The <code>get</code> method retrieves the value associated with a given key. <code>HashMap</code> is ideal for scenarios where fast lookups and updates are necessary, but the order of elements does not matter.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>BTreeMap<K, V></code> type is a sorted map that maintains the elements in a sorted order based on the keys. It provides efficient operations for searching, inserting, and deleting elements while maintaining order. Consider the following example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = BTreeMap::new();
    map.insert(1, "one");
    map.insert(3, "three");
    map.insert(2, "two");
    
    println!("BTreeMap: {:?}", map); // Output: BTreeMap: {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
    
    if let Some(&value) = map.get(&2) {
        println!("Value for key 2: {}", value); // Output: Value for key 2: two
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>BTreeMap::new()</code> creates an empty sorted map, and <code>insert</code> adds key-value pairs while maintaining the order based on keys. The <code>get</code> method retrieves values similarly to <code>HashMap</code>, but the order of elements is sorted. <code>BTreeMap</code> is useful when you need to keep elements sorted or perform range queries.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s containers offer a range of data structures to handle different collection needs. Vectors provide efficient array-like access, linked lists allow for flexible insertions and removals, and associative containers like <code>HashMap</code> and <code>BTreeMap</code> enable key-value storage with various characteristics. Understanding these containers and their appropriate use cases can help you choose the right data structure for your application, optimizing both performance and functionality.
</p>

## 26.14. Vectors
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Vectors, represented by the <code>Vec<T></code> type in Rust, are one of the most commonly used collections. They are dynamically sized arrays that provide a flexible and efficient way to manage a sequence of elements. Vectors are ideal when you need a contiguous block of memory with the ability to grow and shrink as needed, offering fast, indexed access to elements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The concept of vectors revolves around their ability to store elements of the same type in a sequential manner. They allocate memory dynamically, which allows them to adjust their size according to the number of elements they contain. This dynamic sizing capability makes vectors highly versatile for various programming scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Creating and using vectors in Rust is straightforward. To create an empty vector, you can use <code>Vec::new()</code>, and to create a vector with initial elements, you can use the <code>vec!</code> macro. Here is an example of both methods:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec1: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); // Creating an empty vector
    vec1.push(10);
    vec1.push(20);
    vec1.push(30);
    println!("vec1: {:?}", vec1); // Output: vec1: [10, 20, 30]
    
    let vec2 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Creating a vector with initial elements
    println!("vec2: {:?}", vec2); // Output: vec2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Vec::new()</code> initializes an empty vector <code>vec1</code>, to which we add elements using the <code>push</code> method. The <code>vec!</code> macro creates a vector <code>vec2</code> with initial elements directly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Vectors support various common operations, including <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, and indexing. The <code>push</code> method adds an element to the end of the vector, dynamically resizing it if necessary. The <code>pop</code> method removes and returns the last element, reducing the vector's size. Here is an example demonstrating these operations:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = vec![10, 20, 30];
    numbers.push(40);
    println!("After push: {:?}", numbers); // Output: After push: [10, 20, 30, 40]
    
    if let Some(last) = numbers.pop() {
        println!("Popped value: {}", last); // Output: Popped value: 40
    }
    println!("After pop: {:?}", numbers); // Output: After pop: [10, 20, 30]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>numbers.push(40)</code> adds <code>40</code> to the end of the vector, and <code>numbers.pop()</code> removes the last element, which is <code>40</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Indexing is another common operation, allowing direct access to elements at specific positions. Rust provides both immutable and mutable indexing using square brackets. Here is an example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("Element at index 2: {}", vec[2]); // Output: Element at index 2: 3
    
    vec[2] = 30;
    println!("Updated vector: {:?}", vec); // Output: Updated vector: [1, 2, 30, 4, 5]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>vec[2]</code> accesses the element at index 2, which is <code>3</code>. By assigning <code>30</code> to <code>vec[2]</code>, we update the element at that position.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Vectors also provide various utility methods for efficient management and manipulation of elements. The <code>len</code> method returns the number of elements in the vector, while <code>is_empty</code> checks if the vector is empty. The <code>capacity</code> method reveals the number of elements the vector can hold without reallocating memory. Here is an example demonstrating these methods:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Length: {}", vec.len()); // Output: Length: 3
    println!("Is empty: {}", vec.is_empty()); // Output: Is empty: false
    println!("Capacity: {}", vec.capacity()); // Output: Capacity: 3
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>vec.len()</code> returns the number of elements, <code>vec.is_empty()</code> checks if the vector is empty, and <code>vec.capacity()</code> provides the current capacity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Vectors in Rust are a powerful and flexible collection type, offering a range of operations for efficient data management. Their ability to grow and shrink dynamically, coupled with fast, indexed access, makes them a go-to choice for many programming scenarios. Whether you need to manage a sequence of elements, perform dynamic resizing, or access elements by index, vectors provide the necessary functionality to handle these tasks effectively.
</p>

## 26.15. Lists
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, lists come in two primary forms: <code>LinkedList</code> and <code>VecDeque</code>. Each of these collections serves distinct purposes and provides specific functionalities suited to different use cases. Understanding how to use these lists and their operations is crucial for effective programming in Rust.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>LinkedList</code> is a doubly linked list provided by Rustâ€™s standard library. It is a sequential container that allows efficient insertions and removals from both ends of the list. A doubly linked list consists of elements called nodes, where each node contains data and pointers to the next and previous nodes. This structure enables constant-time complexity for adding or removing elements from the front or back, but it has slower indexing compared to vectors. Here is an example of using <code>LinkedList</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::LinkedList;

fn main() {
    let mut list = LinkedList::new();
    list.push_back(1);
    list.push_back(2);
    list.push_front(0);
    
    println!("LinkedList: {:?}", list); // Output: LinkedList: [0, 1, 2]
    
    list.pop_back();
    println!("LinkedList after pop_back: {:?}", list); // Output: LinkedList after pop_back: [0, 1]
    
    list.pop_front();
    println!("LinkedList after pop_front: {:?}", list); // Output: LinkedList after pop_front: [1]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>LinkedList::new()</code> creates an empty linked list. The <code>push_back</code> method adds elements to the end of the list, while <code>push_front</code> adds elements to the front. The <code>pop_back</code> and <code>pop_front</code> methods remove elements from the back and front, respectively. Linked lists are particularly useful when you need to perform frequent insertions and deletions at both ends or in the middle of the list, as these operations are more efficient compared to vectors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>VecDeque</code>, or a double-ended queue, is another sequential container provided by Rustâ€™s standard library. It supports efficient insertions and removals from both ends, similar to <code>LinkedList</code>, but is implemented using a growable ring buffer. This structure allows for faster indexing than <code>LinkedList</code> while still providing constant-time complexity for adding or removing elements at either end. Here is an example of using <code>VecDeque</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    let mut deque = VecDeque::new();
    deque.push_back(1);
    deque.push_back(2);
    deque.push_front(0);
    
    println!("VecDeque: {:?}", deque); // Output: VecDeque: [0, 1, 2]
    
    deque.pop_back();
    println!("VecDeque after pop_back: {:?}", deque); // Output: VecDeque after pop_back: [0, 1]
    
    deque.pop_front();
    println!("VecDeque after pop_front: {:?}", deque); // Output: VecDeque after pop_front: [1]
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>VecDeque::new()</code> creates an empty double-ended queue. The <code>push_back</code> and <code>push_front</code> methods add elements to the end and front, respectively, while <code>pop_back</code> and <code>pop_front</code> remove elements from the back and front. <code>VecDeque</code> is suitable for scenarios where you need efficient access to elements and fast insertions and removals at both ends, such as implementing a queue or a deque.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Both <code>LinkedList</code> and <code>VecDeque</code> offer unique benefits and are tailored to specific use cases. <code>LinkedList</code> is advantageous when frequent insertions and deletions in the middle of the list are necessary, though it comes with a trade-off of slower indexing. On the other hand, <code>VecDeque</code> combines the benefits of fast insertions and removals at both ends with efficient indexing, making it ideal for implementing double-ended queues or other data structures where random access is also important.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s <code>LinkedList</code> and <code>VecDeque</code> provide powerful and efficient ways to manage lists. Whether you need a structure that excels at frequent insertions and deletions in the middle or one that combines efficient access with fast end operations, these collections offer the necessary functionality to handle a wide range of programming scenarios. Understanding their use cases and operations is essential for choosing the right data structure and optimizing your Rust applications.
</p>

## 26.16. Associative Containers
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Associative containers are a critical part of Rustâ€™s standard library, providing efficient ways to store and retrieve data based on keys rather than sequential indexes. The primary associative containers in Rust are <code>HashMap</code> and <code>BTreeMap</code>. These structures allow for quick lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs, making them ideal for scenarios where you need to manage a collection of items that can be efficiently accessed using keys.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>HashMap</code> is an unordered associative container that uses a hashing algorithm to map keys to values. This structure offers average-case constant-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, making it highly efficient for many use cases. The keys must implement the <code>Eq</code> and <code>Hash</code> traits, which ensures that they can be compared for equality and hashed. Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating the basic usage of a <code>HashMap</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    
    // Inserting key-value pairs
    scores.insert(String::from("Alice"), 50);
    scores.insert(String::from("Bob"), 40);
    
    // Accessing values by key
    let score = scores.get(&String::from("Alice"));
    match score {
        Some(&score) => println!("Alice's score: {}", score), // Output: Alice's score: 50
        None => println!("Alice's score not found"),
    }
    
    // Iterating over key-value pairs
    for (key, value) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
    
    // Removing a key-value pair
    scores.remove(&String::from("Bob"));
    println!("Scores after removing Bob: {:?}", scores); // Output: Scores after removing Bob: {"Alice": 50}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create a <code>HashMap</code> to store scores of players. We use the <code>insert</code> method to add key-value pairs, where the keys are player names and the values are their scores. The <code>get</code> method retrieves the score for a given player, and we use pattern matching to handle the option of a value being present or not. Iterating over the map with a <code>for</code> loop allows us to access each key-value pair, and the <code>remove</code> method deletes an entry from the map.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>BTreeMap</code> is an ordered associative container that maintains the elements in a sorted order based on the keys. This structure uses a self-balancing binary search tree, providing logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. <code>BTreeMap</code> is useful when you need to keep elements in order and perform range queries. Here is an example using <code>BTreeMap</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = BTreeMap::new();
    
    // Inserting key-value pairs
    scores.insert("Alice", 50);
    scores.insert("Bob", 40);
    scores.insert("Charlie", 60);
    
    // Accessing values by key
    let score = scores.get(&"Alice");
    match score {
        Some(&score) => println!("Alice's score: {}", score), // Output: Alice's score: 50
        None => println!("Alice's score not found"),
    }
    
    // Iterating over key-value pairs
    for (key, value) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
    
    // Removing a key-value pair
    scores.remove(&"Bob");
    println!("Scores after removing Bob: {:?}", scores); // Output: Scores after removing Bob: {"Alice": 50, "Charlie": 60}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>BTreeMap</code> stores the scores of players and keeps the keys (player names) in sorted order. The <code>insert</code> method adds key-value pairs, and the <code>get</code> method retrieves a value based on the key, just like in <code>HashMap</code>. Iterating over the map with a <code>for</code> loop shows the elements in sorted order, and the <code>remove</code> method deletes an entry from the map.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Associative containers like <code>HashMap</code> and <code>BTreeMap</code> are essential for efficiently managing collections of key-value pairs in Rust. <code>HashMap</code> is optimal for scenarios where fast, unordered access is required, while <code>BTreeMap</code> is suitable for situations needing ordered elements and range queries. Understanding the use cases and operations of these containers enables developers to choose the right data structure for their specific needs, ensuring efficient and effective management of their data.
</p>

## 26.17. Hash Maps
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hash maps are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures in programming, and Rustâ€™s <code>HashMap</code> is no exception. A <code>HashMap</code> is an associative container that maps keys to values, providing efficient methods for insertion, deletion, and retrieval. This data structure is backed by a hashing algorithm, which ensures that keys are distributed uniformly across the underlying storage, allowing for average-case constant-time complexity for basic operations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, a <code>HashMap</code> is defined in the standard library and is part of the <code>std::collections</code> module. The keys and values in a <code>HashMap</code> can be of any type that implements the <code>Eq</code> and <code>Hash</code> traits, ensuring that they can be compared for equality and converted to a hash value. This requirement ensures that the keys are unique and can be stored and retrieved efficiently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Creating a <code>HashMap</code> in Rust is straightforward. The following code demonstrates the creation of a <code>HashMap</code> and various operations such as insertion and retrieval:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    // Creating a new HashMap
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    
    // Inserting key-value pairs
    scores.insert(String::from("Alice"), 50);
    scores.insert(String::from("Bob"), 40);
    
    // Accessing values by key
    let score = scores.get(&String::from("Alice"));
    match score {
        Some(&score) => println!("Alice's score: {}", score), // Output: Alice's score: 50
        None => println!("Alice's score not found"),
    }
    
    // Iterating over key-value pairs
    for (key, value) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
    
    // Removing a key-value pair
    scores.remove(&String::from("Bob"));
    println!("Scores after removing Bob: {:?}", scores); // Output: Scores after removing Bob: {"Alice": 50}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we start by importing the <code>HashMap</code> type from the <code>std::collections</code> module. We then create a mutable <code>HashMap</code> named <code>scores</code> using the <code>HashMap::new</code> method. This initializes an empty hash map where we can store player names as keys and their scores as values. To insert elements into the hash map, we use the <code>insert</code> method, which takes a key and a value as arguments. In this case, we add two players, Alice and Bob, with their respective scores.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To retrieve a value from the hash map, we use the <code>get</code> method, which returns an <code>Option<&V></code> where <code>V</code> is the type of the value stored in the hash map. This means that the <code>get</code> method will return <code>Some(&value)</code> if the key exists, or <code>None</code> if the key is not found. In the example, we attempt to retrieve Aliceâ€™s score and use pattern matching to print it if it exists.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Iterating over the key-value pairs in the hash map is done using a <code>for</code> loop. By iterating over <code>&scores</code>, we get references to each key-value pair, allowing us to print them. Finally, we demonstrate how to remove an element from the hash map using the <code>remove</code> method, which takes a reference to the key and removes the associated key-value pair if it exists.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hash maps are powerful because of their efficiency and flexibility. They are ideal for scenarios where you need to associate unique keys with specific values and perform frequent lookups, insertions, and deletions. Examples include caching, counting occurrences of elements, and implementing dictionaries or associative arrays. Rustâ€™s <code>HashMap</code> provides a robust and easy-to-use implementation that leverages the languageâ€™s strengths in safety and performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, hash maps are a fundamental part of many applications due to their ability to efficiently manage key-value pairs. Rustâ€™s <code>HashMap</code> offers a rich set of operations that make it easy to create, manipulate, and query associative containers. Understanding how to use <code>HashMap</code> effectively allows developers to build powerful and efficient programs that can handle a wide range of data management tasks.
</p>

## 26.18. BTree Maps and Sets
<p style="text-align: justify;">
BTree maps and sets are fundamental data structures in Rustâ€™s standard library, providing ordered collections that support efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. These structures are based on B-trees, which are self-balancing search trees that maintain their elements in sorted order. This makes them particularly useful for scenarios where order is important, such as implementing sorted dictionaries or sets.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A <code>BTreeMap</code> is an associative container that stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the keys. This structure allows for efficient range queries, ordered iteration, and binary search operations. The underlying B-tree ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. This makes <code>BTreeMap</code> an excellent choice for applications that require ordered data and fast access times.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Creating and using a <code>BTreeMap</code> in Rust is straightforward. Here is an example demonstrating basic operations such as insertion, retrieval, and iteration:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() {
    // Creating a new BTreeMap
    let mut scores = BTreeMap::new();
    
    // Inserting key-value pairs
    scores.insert("Alice", 50);
    scores.insert("Bob", 40);
    scores.insert("Charlie", 60);
    
    // Accessing values by key
    if let Some(&score) = scores.get(&"Alice") {
        println!("Alice's score: {}", score); // Output: Alice's score: 50
    }
    
    // Iterating over key-value pairs
    for (key, value) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
    
    // Removing a key-value pair
    scores.remove(&"Bob");
    println!("Scores after removing Bob: {:?}", scores); // Output: Scores after removing Bob: {"Alice": 50, "Charlie": 60}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we import the <code>BTreeMap</code> type from the <code>std::collections</code> module and create a mutable <code>BTreeMap</code> named <code>scores</code> using the <code>BTreeMap::new</code> method. We insert key-value pairs into the map using the <code>insert</code> method, which adds entries while maintaining the order of keys. To retrieve a value, we use the <code>get</code> method, which returns an <code>Option<&V></code>, allowing us to safely handle cases where the key might not exist. We iterate over the map using a <code>for</code> loop, printing each key-value pair. Finally, we remove an entry with the <code>remove</code> method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A <code>BTreeSet</code> is a collection of unique elements stored in a sorted order. It leverages the same B-tree structure as <code>BTreeMap</code>, providing efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and membership tests. <code>BTreeSet</code> is ideal for scenarios where you need a sorted collection of unique elements and efficient range queries.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s an example of creating and using a <code>BTreeSet</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

fn main() {
    // Creating a new BTreeSet
    let mut set = BTreeSet::new();
    
    // Inserting elements
    set.insert(10);
    set.insert(20);
    set.insert(30);
    
    // Checking for membership
    if set.contains(&20) {
        println!("Set contains 20"); // Output: Set contains 20
    }
    
    // Iterating over elements
    for value in &set {
        println!("{}", value);
    }
    
    // Removing an element
    set.remove(&20);
    println!("Set after removing 20: {:?}", set); // Output: Set after removing 20: {10, 30}
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we import the <code>BTreeSet</code> type from the <code>std::collections</code> module and create a mutable <code>BTreeSet</code> named <code>set</code> using the <code>BTreeSet::new</code> method. We insert elements into the set using the <code>insert</code> method, which adds elements while maintaining their order and ensuring uniqueness. To check for the presence of an element, we use the <code>contains</code> method, which returns a boolean indicating whether the element is in the set. We iterate over the set using a <code>for</code> loop, printing each element. Finally, we remove an element using the <code>remove</code> method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Comparing <code>BTreeMap</code> and <code>BTreeSet</code> with their hash-based counterparts (<code>HashMap</code> and <code>HashSet</code>), the primary difference lies in the order of elements. <code>BTreeMap</code> and <code>BTreeSet</code> maintain elements in a sorted order, allowing for efficient range queries and ordered iteration, while <code>HashMap</code> and <code>HashSet</code> do not guarantee any specific order. The choice between these structures depends on the specific requirements of your application: use B-tree-based collections when order is important and hash-based collections when you need the fastest possible access times without concern for order.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, <code>BTreeMap</code> and <code>BTreeSet</code> are powerful tools in Rustâ€™s standard library, providing ordered associative and set-based containers with efficient operations. Their balanced B-tree structure ensures logarithmic time complexity for basic operations, making them suitable for a wide range of applications that require ordered data and efficient access. Understanding these structures and their use cases allows developers to select the most appropriate container for their needs, ensuring both performance and functionality in their programs.
</p>

## 26.19. Container Adaptors
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Container adaptors are specialized classes in Rust's standard library that provide a restricted interface to other underlying container types. These adaptors are designed to present a different view or behavior for the contained elements, while the underlying storage is managed by standard containers like <code>Vec</code> or <code>VecDeque</code>. In Rust, some of the most common container adaptors include stacks, queues, and priority queues. Each of these adaptors serves a specific purpose and provides unique operations that are optimized for certain types of data management and access patterns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>Vec</code> and <code>VecDeque</code> collections are often used as the underlying containers for these adaptors due to their efficient handling of contiguous memory and dynamic resizing capabilities. For example, a stack can be implemented using a <code>Vec</code> because it naturally supports push and pop operations on its end, which align with the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior of a stack.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A stack in Rust can be implemented using <code>Vec</code>. A stack allows elements to be added and removed only from one end, adhering to LIFO semantics. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple stack implementation using <code>Vec</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut stack = Vec::new();

    // Pushing elements onto the stack
    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);

    // Popping elements from the stack
    while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
        println!("{}", top); // Output: 3, 2, 1
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create a stack using <code>Vec::new()</code> and push elements onto it using the <code>push</code> method. The elements are added to the end of the vector. To remove elements, we use the <code>pop</code> method, which removes and returns the last element, demonstrating the LIFO behavior of the stack.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Queues, in contrast, operate on First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principles, where elements are added at the back and removed from the front. The <code>VecDeque</code> type from the <code>std::collections</code> module is well-suited for implementing queues due to its efficient operations on both ends of the deque:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();

    // Enqueuing elements
    queue.push_back(1);
    queue.push_back(2);
    queue.push_back(3);

    // Dequeuing elements
    while let Some(front) = queue.pop_front() {
        println!("{}", front); // Output: 1, 2, 3
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create a queue using <code>VecDeque::new()</code> and add elements to the back of the queue using the <code>push_back</code> method. Elements are removed from the front of the queue using the <code>pop_front</code> method, demonstrating the FIFO behavior.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A priority queue, on the other hand, is an abstract data type that allows for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element. Rust does not have a built-in priority queue, but it can be implemented using the <code>BinaryHeap</code> type from the <code>std::collections</code> module, which maintains a heap structure for efficient priority management:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BinaryHeap;

fn main() {
    let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();

    // Pushing elements onto the heap
    heap.push(5);
    heap.push(1);
    heap.push(10);
    heap.push(3);

    // Popping elements from the heap
    while let Some(top) = heap.pop() {
        println!("{}", top); // Output: 10, 5, 3, 1
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create a priority queue using <code>BinaryHeap::new()</code> and push elements onto it using the <code>push</code> method. The <code>BinaryHeap</code> maintains the elements such that the largest element can be efficiently retrieved and removed using the <code>pop</code> method, which follows the max-heap property by default.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Container adaptors like stacks, queues, and priority queues provide specialized behavior and optimized operations for specific use cases. Stacks are useful for algorithms that require LIFO access, such as depth-first search or backtracking. Queues are ideal for FIFO access patterns, commonly used in breadth-first search or task scheduling. Priority queues are crucial for applications where elements need to be processed based on priority, such as in event simulation systems or shortest-path algorithms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding and utilizing container adaptors effectively allows developers to choose the right data structure for their specific needs, ensuring both performance and clarity in their Rust programs. By leveraging the powerful and flexible container adaptors provided by Rust's standard library, developers can implement efficient and elegant solutions to a wide range of computational problems.
</p>

## 26.20. Stack
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in algorithms and applications where elements need to be accessed and processed in reverse order of their arrival. This makes stacks ideal for scenarios such as function call management in programming languages, expression evaluation in compilers, and backtracking in algorithms like depth-first search.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, stacks can be implemented using various underlying data structures, with <code>Vec</code> being a common choice due to its dynamic resizing capability and efficient operations at the end of the vector. Hereâ€™s how you can implement a stack using <code>Vec</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut stack = Vec::new();

    // Pushing elements onto the stack
    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);

    // Popping elements from the stack
    while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
        println!("{}", top); // Output: 3, 2, 1
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create an empty vector <code>stack</code> using <code>Vec::new()</code>. We then push elements onto the stack using the <code>push</code> method, which adds elements to the end of the vector. The stack operations are demonstrated in the <code>while let Some(top) = stack.pop()</code> loop, where <code>pop</code> removes and returns the last element added (LIFO behavior), printing each element in reverse order.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Stacks are efficient for managing recursive function calls, as each function call's state can be pushed onto the stack and popped off when the function completes. This enables the program to return to the previous function call's context, making stacks crucial for maintaining program execution flow and memory management in many programming languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing a stack using <code>Vec</code> in Rust leverages Rust's ownership and borrowing system to ensure memory safety and efficient operations. The dynamic resizing of <code>Vec</code> ensures that the stack can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed, maintaining optimal performance for stack operations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Stacks are fundamental data structures that enable efficient Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access patterns. They find applications in various fields of computer science and software engineering, providing essential support for algorithmic operations, function call management, and state maintenance. By implementing stacks using <code>Vec</code> in Rust, developers can leverage Rust's safety guarantees and performance optimizations to build robust and efficient applications that require stack-based data management.
</p>

## 26.21. Queue
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are widely used in various applications and algorithms where order of processing is essential, such as in scheduling tasks, managing requests in web servers, breadth-first search in graphs, and in real-time systems where tasks must be processed in the order they arrive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, queues can be efficiently implemented using the <code>VecDeque</code> type from the <code>std::collections</code> module. <code>VecDeque</code> (short for "vector double-ended queue") provides efficient operations at both ends of the sequence, making it an ideal choice for implementing a queue. This is due to its underlying ring buffer implementation, which ensures that both push and pop operations at either end are efficient.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how you can implement a queue using <code>VecDeque</code> in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn main() {
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();

    // Enqueuing elements
    queue.push_back(1);
    queue.push_back(2);
    queue.push_back(3);

    // Dequeuing elements
    while let Some(front) = queue.pop_front() {
        println!("{}", front); // Output: 1, 2, 3
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create an empty <code>VecDeque</code> using <code>VecDeque::new()</code>. Elements are added to the back of the queue using the <code>push_back</code> method. The <code>while let Some(front) = queue.pop_front()</code> loop demonstrates the dequeue operation, where <code>pop_front</code> removes and returns the front element of the queue, ensuring FIFO behavior. Each element is printed in the order it was added, demonstrating the queue's FIFO properties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Queues are essential in many areas of computer science and software engineering. For instance, in operating systems, queues are used for managing processes and tasks, ensuring that each task gets processed in the order it was received. In network applications, queues manage incoming requests, handling each request sequentially to maintain order and fairness. In algorithms, queues are used for level-order traversal of trees, breadth-first search in graphs, and in simulations where events must be processed in a specific sequence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing a queue using <code>VecDeque</code> in Rust takes advantage of Rust's ownership and borrowing system to ensure memory safety and efficiency. The <code>VecDeque</code> type is optimized for adding and removing elements from both ends, providing the performance characteristics needed for queue operations. This makes <code>VecDeque</code> a robust and efficient choice for implementing queues in Rust applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Queues are fundamental data structures that support First-In-First-Out (FIFO) access patterns, making them essential for many real-world applications and algorithms. By using <code>VecDeque</code> in Rust, developers can efficiently manage sequences of elements with operations optimized for both ends of the container. This enables the construction of robust and efficient applications that rely on queue-based data management.
</p>

## 26.22. Priority Queue
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A priority queue is an advanced data structure that, unlike a regular queue, associates each element with a priority level. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority, even if they were enqueued later. This behavior makes priority queues essential in scenarios where certain tasks or elements need to be processed before others, such as in task scheduling, simulations, Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and various other real-time applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, priority queues can be efficiently implemented using the <code>BinaryHeap</code> type from the <code>std::collections</code> module. A <code>BinaryHeap</code> is a binary tree-based data structure that ensures the highest (or lowest) priority element is always at the top, enabling efficient access and removal of the highest priority element.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how you can implement a priority queue using <code>BinaryHeap</code> in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::BinaryHeap;

fn main() {
    let mut heap = BinaryHeap::new();

    // Inserting elements with priorities
    heap.push(3); // Lower priority
    heap.push(5); // Higher priority
    heap.push(1); // Lowest priority
    heap.push(4); // Mid priority

    // Popping elements from the heap
    while let Some(top) = heap.pop() {
        println!("{}", top); // Output: 5, 4, 3, 1
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create an empty <code>BinaryHeap</code> using <code>BinaryHeap::new()</code>. Elements are added to the heap using the <code>push</code> method, which automatically maintains the heap property (i.e., the highest priority element is always at the root). The <code>while let Some(top) = heap.pop()</code> loop demonstrates how to remove and retrieve elements in order of their priority. The elements are printed in descending order of their priority, illustrating how the highest priority elements are processed first.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Priority queues are crucial in many areas of computer science and software engineering. For example, in operating systems, priority queues manage process scheduling, ensuring that high-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones. In network routing algorithms like Dijkstra's, priority queues efficiently manage the exploration of the shortest paths by always expanding the currently known shortest path first. In real-time systems, priority queues handle event scheduling where certain events must be processed before others to meet time constraints.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing a priority queue using <code>BinaryHeap</code> in Rust takes advantage of Rust's strong type system and safety guarantees. The <code>BinaryHeap</code> type is optimized for efficiently maintaining the heap property, providing fast insertion and removal of elements based on their priority. This makes <code>BinaryHeap</code> a robust and efficient choice for implementing priority queues in Rust applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Priority queues are advanced data structures that enable efficient management of elements based on their priority levels. They are essential for applications and algorithms where certain tasks or elements must be processed before others. By using <code>BinaryHeap</code> in Rust, developers can leverage an efficient and safe implementation of priority queues, ensuring that high-priority elements are always processed first, leading to robust and performant applications.
</p>

## 26.23. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For beginners in Rust, understanding how to use collections efficiently and elegantly is crucial for writing effective code. Rustâ€™s standard library offers a rich set of collection types, each designed for specific use cases and performance characteristics. To make the most of these collections, it's important to grasp their internal representations, the nature of elements they store, and the operations they support.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Vectors (<code>Vec<T></code>) are a versatile collection type, allowing dynamic resizing and efficient indexing. They are ideal for storing a sequence of elements when the number of elements may change. Beginners should use vectors when they need a resizable array-like structure with fast access and modification. To avoid unnecessary reallocations, it's advisable to use the <code>with_capacity</code> method to preallocate space if the number of elements can be estimated in advance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For situations where you need to store elements in a key-value format, associative containers like <code>HashMap<K, V></code> and <code>BTreeMap<K, V></code> are invaluable. <code>HashMap</code> offers fast access times on average but does not maintain order, while <code>BTreeMap</code> keeps keys in sorted order and provides consistent performance characteristics. Choosing between these depends on whether you need ordered data or prioritize access speed. It's important to implement or derive the <code>Hash</code> and <code>Eq</code> traits for keys used in <code>HashMap</code> to ensure proper behavior.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Linked lists (<code>LinkedList<T></code>) and double-ended queues (<code>VecDeque<T></code>) are suitable for cases where frequent insertions and deletions at both ends of the collection are necessary. However, they generally offer slower random access compared to vectors, so they should be used when the primary operations involve modifying the start or end of the list rather than accessing elements by index.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For specialized uses, container adaptors like stacks, queues, and priority queues can be constructed from these basic collections. For instance, a stack can be implemented using a <code>Vec<T></code> with <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> methods, while a queue can utilize a <code>VecDeque<T></code>. Priority queues, often used in algorithms like Dijkstra's, can be efficiently managed with a <code>BinaryHeap<T></code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When choosing a collection, always consider the specific operations you need to perform and the performance characteristics they require. For example, if you frequently need to check for the presence of an element, <code>HashSet<T></code> might be more appropriate than <code>Vec<T></code>, as it provides faster membership testing. Conversely, if you need to maintain elements in a specific order, consider <code>Vec<T></code> or <code>BTreeSet<T></code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Efficiency also involves being mindful of the ownership and borrowing rules in Rust. Understanding these principles can help avoid unnecessary cloning of elements and enable safe and concurrent modifications. When working with large data sets, prefer to use references or slices to avoid copying data. Additionally, leveraging Rust's iterator traits can lead to more idiomatic and efficient code by allowing functional-style operations such as map, filter, and fold.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, remember that choosing the right collection and using it properly can have a significant impact on the performance and clarity of your code. Avoid common pitfalls like excessive use of dynamic allocation or choosing a complex data structure when a simpler one would suffice. Rust's type system and borrow checker will often guide you towards safer and more efficient designs, so take advantage of these features to write robust, maintainable code. By carefully selecting and using Rust's collections, you can create efficient, clear, and elegant solutions to a wide range of programming challenges.
