<p style="text-align: justify;">
Chapter 11 of TRPL explores essential building blocks like structs, unions, and enums, which are critical for defining complex types tailored to specific application needs. The chapter starts with a detailed examination of structs, fundamental to Rust programming, allowing you to bundle related data into a single type for better organization and manipulation. It then covers unions, a specialized data type that stores multiple, potentially unrelated types in the same memory space, useful for low-level memory manipulation but requiring careful handling to avoid undefined behavior. Finally, the chapter delves into Rust's powerful and flexible enums, which handle values that can be one of several variants, with each variant potentially carrying different data, enhancing type safety and expressiveness. By mastering these constructs, readers gain the ability to model and manage data effectively, creating well-organized, efficient, and robust applications in Rust.

## 11.1. Structures
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, just as in C++, a struct is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related variables of diverse types. This is essential for creating logically grouped data structures. Rust's structs provide a clear model for representing complex data in a way that aligns with Rust's focus on safety and memory efficiency. Hereâ€™s an illustrative example in Rust that represents a Book in a library system, demonstrating how structs can be used to encapsulate diverse data types:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    pages: u32,
    isbn: String,
    available: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let mut book = Book {
        title: "The Rust Programming Language".to_string(),
        author: "Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols".to_string(),
        pages: 552,
        isbn: "978-1593278281".to_string(),
        available: true,
    };

    // Access and modify the data using dot notation
    println!("Book title: {}", book.title);
    println!("Book author: {}", book.author);
    println!("Book pages: {}", book.pages);
    println!("Book ISBN: {}", book.isbn);
    println!("Book available: {}", book.available);

    // Update availability of the book
    book.available = false;
    println!("Book available after update: {}", book.available);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust example, <code>Book</code> is defined as a struct with fields of various types, including <code>String</code>, <code>u32</code>, and <code>bool</code>. Variables of type <code>Book</code> can be declared and initialized using the <code>{}</code> notation, which is quite intuitive and clear. Just like in C++, individual members of a Rust struct can be accessed and modified using the dot (.) operator.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Structs in Rust can also be accessed through references, and Rust uses the <code>&</code> symbol to denote a reference, simplifying the syntax compared to C++ pointers and making it safer by enforcing strict borrowing rules at compile time:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    pages: u32,
    isbn: String,
    available: bool,
}

fn print_book_info(book: &Book) {
    println!("{} by {}", book.title, book.author);
    println!("ISBN: {}", book.isbn);
    println!("Pages: {}", book.pages);
    println!("Available: {}", book.available);
}

fn main() {
    let book = Book {
        title: "The Rust Programming Language".to_string(),
        author: "Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols".to_string(),
        pages: 552,
        isbn: "978-1593278281".to_string(),
        available: true,
    };

    print_book_info(&book);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this function, <code>print_book_info</code>, the book is passed by reference, allowing the function to read the struct's data without taking ownership of it, which is consistent with Rustâ€™s memory safety principles.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Just as with C++, Rust structs can be passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables. However, Rust does not support operator overloading for operations like comparison directly on structs by default. Developers can implement traits such as <code>PartialEq</code> to enable comparison if needed, ensuring that all operations are explicit and memory-safe.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This structured approach to using structs in Rust not only maintains organizational clarity but also leverages Rust's stringent compile-time checks to prevent common errors associated with memory management, adhering to the language's commitment to safety and efficiency.
</p>

### 11.1.1. Struct Layout
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A struct organizes its members in the order they are declared. However, the layout of a struct in memory involves more than just placing these members sequentially. For instance, consider a Rust struct designed to store sensor readings:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct SensorReadout {
    timestamp: u32,  // Unix timestamp in seconds
    temperature: f32,  // Temperature in Celsius
    humidity: f32,  // Relative humidity percentage
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, each field of the <code>SensorReadout</code> struct represents a different type of data collected by a sensor. Rust stores these fields in memory in the order they are declared, with <code>timestamp</code> followed by <code>temperature</code> and then <code>humidity</code>. However, the actual memory size of the struct might be greater than the sum of its individual fields due to alignment requirements. Rust, like many systems languages, aligns data in memory to match the architecture's word size to optimize access speeds. This alignment can introduce padding between fields to align the next field on an appropriate memory boundary.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, if <code>timestamp</code> (a 32-bit integer) is followed by <code>temperature</code> (a 32-bit float), there might not be any padding between them if both are aligned to 4 bytes. However, introducing an 8-byte data type or rearranging fields might lead to padding to ensure each is correctly aligned:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct SensorReadoutOptimized {
    timestamp: u32,
    humidity: f32,
    temperature: f32,  // Moved to ensure no padding if following a 32-bit float
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this optimized version, rearranging <code>humidity</code> and <code>temperature</code> ensures there is no unnecessary padding between them, assuming both require the same alignment. This example highlights the importance of field order for memory efficiency, although Rust compilers are adept at optimizing struct layouts for common architectures.
</p>

### 11.1.2. Struct Names
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The name of a struct type is available for use immediately after its declaration begins, which means it can be used forward in contexts where a full definition is not required. For example, this allows for the definition of linked data structures:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Node {
    data: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,  // Recursive type with partial definition
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this recursive struct definition, <code>Node</code> is partially defined when specifying the type of <code>next</code>. Rust allows this kind of forward declaration using <code>Option<Box<Node>></code> which provides a way to allocate nodes dynamically on the heap. However, unlike C++, Rust requires that the struct be fully defined before it can be instantiated or fully utilized in functions that require knowledge of its complete layout:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn create_node(data: i32) -> Node {
    Node { data, next: None }
}

fn add_node(head: &mut Option<Box<Node>>, data: i32) {
    let new_node = Box::new(create_node(data));
    new_node.next = head.take();
    *head = Some(new_node);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These functions demonstrate how structs are used in Rust once they are fully defined. Rust's type system and its requirement for a complete definition before use prevent many common errors associated with incomplete types, such as improper memory allocation or access violations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, understanding struct layouts and names in Rust not only provides insights into memory management and efficient data structuring but also ensures that Rust programs are safe, predictable, and efficient.
</p>

### 11.1.3. Structures and Classes
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, structures (<code>struct</code>) are similar to classes in C++ with one notable distinction: Rust doesnâ€™t have classes per se, but uses structs for data structure definition where all members are public by default. However, Rust also utilizes traits to define shared behaviors, akin to methods in classes. To demonstrate this, consider a struct representing a collection of geographical coordinates:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Coordinates {
    points: Vec<(f32, f32)>, // Vector of tuples for latitude and longitude
}

impl Coordinates {
    // Constructor to create Coordinates with one point
    fn new(lat: f32, long: f32) -> Self {
        Self { points: vec![(lat, long)] }
    }

    // Constructor to create Coordinates with multiple points
    fn with_points(points: Vec<(f32, f32)>) -> Self {
        Self { points }
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Coordinates</code> includes methods for initialization, similar to constructors in C++. The <code>new</code> function initializes <code>Coordinates</code> with a single point, while <code>with_points</code> initializes it with multiple points. Unlike C++, Rust does not have constructors in the traditional sense but instead uses associated functions to initialize structs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust ensures all variables are initialized when they are created, thus preventing issues like uninitialized data common in C++:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let single_point = Coordinates::new(40.7128, -74.0060);
let multiple_points = Coordinates::with_points(vec![(34.0522, -118.2437), (37.7749, -122.4194)]);
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach in Rust, where constructors are explicitly defined as associated functions, ensures that each variable is safely and predictably initialized, adhering to Rustâ€™s strict safety guarantees. Moreover, Rustâ€™s pattern of initializing structures directly (using <code>{}</code> for example) and its system for constructor functions (<code>new</code>) offer a clear, concise way to create instances while ensuring that all data complies with the defined structure and initialization logic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a struct in Rust that needs more sophisticated initialization, such as validating input data:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Address {
    name: String,
    number: u32,
    street: String,
    town: String,
    state: String,
    zip: String,
}

impl Address {
    fn new(name: String, number: u32, street: String, town: String, state: String, zip: String) -> Result<Self, String> {
        if state.len() != 2 {
            return Err("State abbreviation should be two characters".to_string());
        }
        if zip.len() != 5 {
            return Err("ZIP code must be five digits".to_string());
        }
        Ok(Self { name, number, street, town, state, zip })
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>Address::new</code> performs validations to ensure the state code and ZIP code are of the expected length, returning a <code>Result</code> type to handle potential errors during address creation. This method enhances data integrity and aligns with Rust's emphasis on safety and correctness, demonstrating a more structured and error-resistant approach compared to traditional methods in C++. This structured and explicit method of constructing and validating data encapsulates Rust's philosophy of ensuring safety and robustness in software design.
</p>

### 11.1.4. Structures and Vectors
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Just as structures can neatly encapsulate various data types, they can also efficiently house arrays, enabling the creation of complex data structures that are both accessible and mutable. This arrangement is particularly useful for scenarios where an ordered collection of similar items is needed within a single structure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a struct in Rust designed to hold a sequence of numerical identifiers, demonstrating how arrays can be integrated within structs:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct IdentifierSet {
    ids: [i32; 3],  // An array of three integers
}

fn main() {
    let mut id_set = IdentifierSet {
        ids: [101, 102, 103],
    };

    // Access and modify the array within the struct
    id_set.ids[1] = 202;
    println!("Updated IDs: {:?}", id_set.ids);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example illustrates a <code>IdentifierSet</code> struct containing an array of three integers. Arrays within structs in Rust are declared by specifying the type and the fixed size of the array, encapsulating it within the struct. This design not only groups related data but also maintains the order and fixed size of the collection.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Structures in Rust can also perform operations on arrays they contain, such as in a function that modifies each element of the array:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct IdentifierSet {
    ids: [i32; 3], // An array of three integers
}

fn shift_ids(id_set: &mut IdentifierSet, shift_amount: i32) {
    for id in id_set.ids.iter_mut() {
        *id += shift_amount;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut id_set = IdentifierSet {
        ids: [101, 102, 103],
    };

    shift_ids(&mut id_set, 100);
    println!("Shifted IDs: {:?}", id_set.ids);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the <code>shift_ids</code> function, we iterate over the array within the <code>IdentifierSet</code> struct and modify each element. This is straightforward in Rust due to its powerful iterator methods that allow direct manipulation of each item.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Unlike C++, where array management might require careful handling of pointers and size management, Rustâ€™s approach to arrays in structs is both safe and intuitive, leveraging Rustâ€™s strong type system and safety guarantees. This method prevents common errors such as buffer overflows and off-by-one errors, which are typical in systems programming.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using Rust's array types within structs offers clear syntax and robust performance while maintaining the integrity and alignment of the data. This approach underscores Rustâ€™s commitment to providing safe, efficient, and highly maintainable code structures, suitable for a wide range of programming tasks from systems level to application software.
</p>

### 11.1.5. Type Equivalence
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each struct defines a unique type, even if two structs contain identical fields. This means that different structs are treated as distinct types by the compiler, regardless of their similarities in structure. For example, consider the following scenario where we define two structs intended to represent coordinates on a grid:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Point1 {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

struct Point2 {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point1 = Point1 { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let point2 = Point2 { x: 5, y: 10 };
    // let new_point: Point1 = point2; // This would result in a type mismatch error
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>Point1</code> and <code>Point2</code> are structurally identical but are considered different types. Attempting to assign a <code>Point2</code> instance to a <code>Point1</code> variable directly would result in a compilation error due to type mismatch.
</p>

### 11.1.6. Plain Old Data (POD)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the concept of "Plain Old Data" (POD) doesn't exist as it does in some other languages. Instead, Rust has similar notions, such as "trivially copyable" types, which are part of its type system's safety guarantees. Rust emphasizes safety and memory correctness, ensuring that any data manipulation adheres to its strict ownership and borrowing rules. However, for simpler data types, Rust allows operations that are analogous to what would be performed on PODs in other languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a struct in Rust designed to represent RGB color values:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
struct Color {
    red: u8,
    green: u8,
    blue: u8,
}

impl Color {
    fn new(red: u8, green: u8, blue: u8) -> Self {
        Color { red, green, blue }
    }
}

fn shift_color_intensity(color: &mut Color, adjustment: i8) {
    color.red = ((color.red as i16 + adjustment as i16).max(0).min(255)) as u8;
    color.green = ((color.green as i16 + adjustment as i16).max(0).min(255)) as u8;
    color.blue = ((color.blue as i16 + adjustment as i16).max(0).min(255)) as u8;
}

fn main() {
    let mut my_color = Color::new(120, 65, 255);
    shift_color_intensity(&mut my_color, 10);
    println!("{:?}", my_color);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Color</code> struct is defined with <code>Copy</code> and <code>Clone</code> traits, allowing it to be copied and passed around easily like a POD. The <code>shift_color_intensity</code> function modifies the color's intensity safely. This approach leverages Rust's traits system to clearly define when a type behaves like a POD, providing both flexibility and safety.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s careful handling of types and memory ensures that developers work within a framework that prevents common errors such as data races and invalid memory access, typical in systems-level programming. This structured approach guarantees that Rust programs are both efficient and correct by design, maintaining the integrity of data throughout the program's execution.
</p>

### 11.1.7. Packing Fields
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust offers a way to define compact data structures where fields are tightly packed, a concept particularly useful in systems programming where memory efficiency is crucial. While Rust does not directly support bit-fields in the same manner as C++, it allows for similar optimizations through the use of explicit types and manual bit manipulation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following example where we define a struct to handle state information for a device, with each state represented as a single bit within an integer:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
#[repr(C)]
struct DeviceState {
    states: u32,  // Stores all states in a single 32-bit integer
}

impl DeviceState {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { states: 0 }
    }

    // Enables a specific state bit
    fn set_state(&mut self, bit: u8) {
        self.states |= 1 << bit;
    }

    // Disables a specific state bit
    fn clear_state(&mut self, bit: u8) {
        self.states &= !(1 << bit);
    }

    // Checks if a specific state bit is enabled
    fn is_set(&self, bit: u8) -> bool {
        (self.states & (1 << bit)) != 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut device = DeviceState::new();
    device.set_state(1);  // Set the second bit
    device.set_state(3);  // Set the fourth bit

    println!("State 1 is set: {}", device.is_set(1));
    println!("State 2 is set: {}", device.is_set(2));

    device.clear_state(1);  // Clear the second bit
    println!("After clearing, State 1 is set: {}", device.is_set(1));
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>DeviceState</code> struct uses a single <code>u32</code> field to manage up to 32 boolean state flags, effectively packing these "fields" within one integer. This manual handling of bits is typical in low-level Rust programming, especially when interfacing with hardware or performing optimization-sensitive tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach mirrors the functionality of bit-fields in that it allows multiple flags or small data fields to be stored compactly within a larger integer, utilizing bitwise operations to manipulate these fields. The use of <code>#[repr(C)]</code> ensures that the struct has a compatible memory layout with C, which can be critical in systems programming and interfacing with other languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This method in Rust, though requiring more explicit management compared to automatic bit-fields in some languages, offers precise control over memory layout and data handling. This level of control is crucial in contexts where performance and memory efficiency are paramount, such as embedded systems, operating systems, and other low-level applications. Rust's explicit approach ensures that the programmer remains in full control over how data is stored and manipulated, thereby preventing many common bugs associated with implicit behaviors and automations.
</p>

## 11.2. Unions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Unions in Rust provide a way to manage different types of data in the same memory location, which can be useful for optimizing memory usage. A union allows multiple fields to share the same storage space, but only one field can be used at any given time, making them suitable for data that may have multiple representations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a scenario in a media application where an asset might be an image or a text snippet, but never both simultaneously:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
#[derive(Debug)]
enum MediaType {
    Img,
    Text,
}

#[repr(C)]
union MediaData {
    img_data: Box<[u8]>,  // Assume image data is a byte array
    text_data: String,    // Text data is a String
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct MediaAsset {
    media_type: MediaType,
    data: MediaData,
}

impl MediaAsset {
    fn new_image(data: Vec<u8>) -> Self {
        MediaAsset {
            media_type: MediaType::Img,
            data: MediaData { img_data: data.into_boxed_slice() },
        }
    }

    fn new_text(data: String) -> Self {
        MediaAsset {
            media_type: MediaType::Text,
            data: MediaData { text_data: data },
        }
    }

    fn describe(&self) {
        unsafe {
            match self.media_type {
                MediaType::Img => {
                    // Accessing the img_data field of the union
                    println!("Media type: Image, Data length: {}", self.data.img_data.len());
                },
                MediaType::Text => {
                    // Accessing the text_data field of the union
                    println!("Media type: Text, Data: {}", self.data.text_data);
                },
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let image_asset = MediaAsset::new_image(vec![255, 224, 100]);
    let text_asset = MediaAsset::new_text("Hello, world!".to_string());

    image_asset.describe();
    text_asset.describe();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example illustrates how a union <code>MediaData</code> can hold either image data or text data, depending on the <code>media_type</code>. The <code>describe</code> method uses unsafe code to access the data in the union, reflecting the Rust requirement to explicitly handle unsafe operations involving unions. This explicit handling is crucial as it compels developers to ensure that the correct data type is accessed, preventing type mismatches and potential memory safety errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s approach to unions is designed to be used with caution, primarily in situations where controlling memory layout is critical, such as interfacing with hardware or other low-level systems programming. This use of unions can significantly reduce memory footprint by allowing different types of data to share the same space.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, due to their complexity and the safety implications of incorrect usage, unions are less commonly used in high-level Rust programming. Rust encourages using safer alternatives such as enums with variants for different data types, which provide built-in safety checks and pattern matching without the risk of undefined behavior. This makes Rust unions a specialized tool in the Rust programmer's toolbox, employed primarily when other, safer alternatives are not feasible.
</p>

### 11.2.1. Unions and Their Use
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Unions are primarily used to manage memory in an efficient manner by allowing different types of data to share the same memory space. This is particularly useful in scenarios where data may have multiple possible representations but only one representation is used at any given time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Let's consider an example where a sensor might output data in either integer or float format, but the format used can vary depending on the context or configuration:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
#[repr(C)]
union SensorData {
    int_data: i32,
    float_data: f32,
}

struct Sensor {
    data_type: DataType,
    data: SensorData,
}

enum DataType {
    Integer,
    FloatingPoint,
}

impl Sensor {
    fn new_int(value: i32) -> Self {
        Sensor {
            data_type: DataType::Integer,
            data: SensorData { int_data: value },
        }
    }

    fn new_float(value: f32) -> Self {
        Sensor {
            data_type: DataType::FloatingPoint,
            data: SensorData { float_data: value },
        }
    }

    fn get_data(&self) -> String {
        unsafe {
            match self.data_type {
                DataType::Integer => format!("Int data: {}", self.data.int_data),
                DataType::FloatingPoint => format!("Float data: {}", self.data.float_data),
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let sensor = Sensor::new_int(42);
    println!("{}", sensor.get_data());

    let sensor_float = Sensor::new_float(3.14);
    println!("{}", sensor_float.get_data());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust example, the <code>Sensor</code> struct contains a union <code>SensorData</code> that can hold either integer (<code>i32</code>) or floating point (<code>f32</code>) data. The <code>data_type</code> field in the <code>Sensor</code> struct is used to safely determine the type of data currently stored in the union, ensuring the correct interpretation of the data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The use of unions in Rust requires careful handling due to Rust's strict safety rules. Access to union fields must be done within an <code>unsafe</code> block, reflecting the fact that Rust cannot guarantee the type of data currently stored in the union without explicit management by the programmer.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach, while it involves manual handling of safety via the <code>DataType</code> enum, eliminates many common errors associated with unions in other languages:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Rust prevents accessing uninitialized fields by requiring explicit management of the type state.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">It disallows accidental type mismatches by ensuring the programmer specifies expected behavior through safe patterns such as match statements.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The pattern used in Rust ensures that any interaction with union data is clearly marked as unsafe, reminding the programmer to handle data carefully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This pattern of combining unions with enums for type safety is a common idiom in Rust, known as "tagged unions" or "discriminated unions," and can be seen in more evolved forms in Rust's own <code>enum</code> definitions with data.
</p>

### 11.2.2. Managing Union Variants
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust provides a safer and more structured approach to manage unions that may contain different types of data at different times. Unlike anonymous unions, Rust utilizes <code>enum</code> with explicit variants, each potentially holding different types of data. This construct in Rust not only handles the union of different data types but also embeds the tag within the type, eliminating the need for explicit tag management.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a data structure representing a user input that can either be a numeric ID or a username string:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum UserInput {
    Id(i32),
    Username(String),
}

impl UserInput {
    fn new_id(id: i32) -> Self {
        UserInput::Id(id)
    }

    fn new_username(name: String) -> Self {
        UserInput::Username(name)
    }

    fn get_id(&self) -> Option<i32> {
        if let UserInput::Id(id) = self {
            Some(*id)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }

    fn get_username(&self) -> Option<&String> {
        if let UserInput::Username(name) = self {
            Some(name)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }

    fn set_id(&mut self, id: i32) {
        *self = UserInput::Id(id);
    }

    fn set_username(&mut self, name: String) {
        *self = UserInput::Username(name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = UserInput::new_id(1001);
    if let Some(id) = input.get_id() {
        println!("ID: {}", id);
    }

    input.set_username("john_doe".to_string());
    if let Some(name) = input.get_username() {
        println!("Username: {}", name);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust example, <code>UserInput</code> is an enum that can distinctly be an integer ID or a username string. This kind of enum is sometimes referred to as a "tagged union" or "discriminated union" because the variant itself carries the tag.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The functionality of the <code>UserInput</code> enum in Rust is thoughtfully designed to balance ease of use with robust safety features. Initialization and modification are straightforward, allowing developers to set and change the data type held by <code>UserInput</code> through constructors like <code>new_id</code> and <code>new_username</code>, as well as modification functions like <code>set_id</code> and <code>set_username</code>. Safe access is ensured by methods such as <code>get_id</code> and <code>get_username</code>, which perform checks and return an <code>Option</code> type, indicating whether the requested data matches the current enum variant. This approach removes the need for manual type tracking and error-prone tag checks, simplifying the code and reducing potential errors. Additionally, this implementation takes full advantage of Rustâ€™s strong type system, ensuring that each variant is handled correctly. This prevents memory safety issues and logical errors commonly associated with traditional union usage, highlighting Rust's commitment to safety and reliability in software development.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach significantly reduces the complexity and potential errors associated with union management by embedding type safety directly into the language's type system, making it a robust solution for managing data that can exist in multiple formats.
</p>

## 11.3. Enumerations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Enumerations in Rust, commonly referred to as <code>enums</code>, are a powerful feature that go beyond simply enumerating values. They are used to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. This differs significantly from enumerations in many other languages, as Rust's enums can carry data alongside each variant, making them more akin to algebraic data types found in functional programming languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Let's explore an example that demonstrates the versatility of Rust enums by defining a <code>Message</code> enum to represent different types of communications in a network application:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        match self {
            Message::Quit => {
                println!("Quit the application");
            },
            Message::Move { x, y } => {
                println!("Move to x: {}, y: {}", x, y);
            },
            Message::Write(text) => {
                println!("Text message: {}", text);
            },
            Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => {
                println!("Change color to Red: {}, Green: {}, Blue: {}", r, g, b);
            },
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let messages = [
        Message::Quit,
        Message::Move { x: 30, y: 50 },
        Message::Write(String::from("Hello, Rust!")),
        Message::ChangeColor(0, 150, 255),
    ];

    for message in &messages {
        message.call();
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>Message</code> enum in Rust showcases the flexibility and power of Rust's enum system by defining variants with different data types. Some variants, such as <code>Quit</code>, do not have any associated data, making them simple flags. Other variants, like <code>Move</code>, include named fields, allowing for more descriptive and self-documenting code. Additionally, variants like <code>ChangeColor</code> carry multiple unnamed data fields, demonstrating the ability to group related data together even without explicit names.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pattern matching, a key feature in Rust, is utilized effectively through the <code>match</code> expression in the <code>call</code> method to handle each variant specifically. This approach allows for clean and concise code that can destructure and process each enum variant according to its unique data structure. By matching on each variant, the program can execute the appropriate logic for each type, ensuring that all possible cases are accounted for and handled properly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s enums are more powerful than traditional enums found in other programming languages, which are often limited to being simple integer constants. In contrast, Rustâ€™s enums can carry complex and varied types of data. This is exemplified by the <code>Write</code> variant, which holds a <code>String</code>. This capability allows enums in Rust to encapsulate different kinds of data and behavior in a type-safe manner, making the language both expressive and robust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach underscores Rust's capability to use enums not just as a list of names, but as a core part of type-safe data handling within applications. This feature drastically reduces errors like invalid state handling and improves code clarity by encapsulating related data and behavior into a single, well-defined type.
</p>

### 11.3.1. Enum Layout
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, an enumeration, or enum, is a type that can encapsulate different types and values in its variants. Each variant can optionally have associated data. Rust enums are scoped and strongly typed, providing a safe way to use constant values while encapsulating related variants together with their respective data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider an example of a traffic control system where signals are represented as enums and each signal can carry additional data pertinent to its state:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum TrafficSignal {
    Red(u8), // duration in seconds
    Green(u8),
    Yellow(u8),
}

impl TrafficSignal {
    fn time_remaining(&self) -> u8 {
        match self {
            TrafficSignal::Red(t) | TrafficSignal::Green(t) | TrafficSignal::Yellow(t) => *t,
        }
    }

    fn change(&mut self) {
        *self = match *self {
            TrafficSignal::Red(_) => TrafficSignal::Green(30),
            TrafficSignal::Green(_) => TrafficSignal::Yellow(5),
            TrafficSignal::Yellow(_) => TrafficSignal::Red(45),
        };
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut signal = TrafficSignal::Red(45);
    println!("Current signal time: {} seconds", signal.time_remaining());
    signal.change();
    println!("Next signal: {} seconds", signal.time_remaining());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation, Rust enums showcase their versatility by carrying distinct types and quantities of data, allowing for significant expressive power. Unlike traditional enums that might be limited to mere integer associations, Rustâ€™s enums allow for each variant to be explicitly handled, enhancing safety and ensuring comprehensive coverage in pattern matching.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, enums in Rust can be equipped with methods, as shown in the <code>TrafficSignal</code> enum. These methods demonstrate operations like checking the time remaining for a traffic signal and transitioning to the next state, which are critical operations in a traffic control system. The usage of pattern matching in Rust facilitates operations based on the current enum variant without risking access to invalid or inappropriate data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By integrating data and functionality within enums, Rust elevates the utility of this feature far beyond traditional enumerations found in many programming languages, promoting maintainability and robustness in systems programming.
</p>

### 11.3.2. Basic Enums
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The simplest form of an enumeration (<code>enum</code>) is similar to enums in other programming languages, in that it provides a way to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Unlike in some languages where enums are merely aliases for integers, Rust enums are full-fledged types that do not implicitly convert to integer values. This ensures type safety and enhances code clarity by explicitly defining the scope and purpose of each enumeration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate basic enums in Rust, consider defining roles in a role-playing game, where each role can have unique attributes and actions:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum Role {
    Warrior,
    Mage,
    Archer,
}

fn describe_role(role: &Role) -> &'static str {
    match role {
        Role::Warrior => "Warrior: Bravery and close combat.",
        Role::Mage => "Mage: Wisdom and spells.",
        Role::Archer => "Archer: Agility and precision.",
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_role = Role::Mage;
    println!("You chose a {}", describe_role(&my_role));
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s enums are scoped, meaning that the variants of an enum must be accessed through the enum's name, such as <code>Role::Mage</code>. This scoping mechanism helps prevent name clashes, as it clearly differentiates between variants from different enums, and it improves code readability by making it explicit which enum a variant belongs to. This structured approach ensures that code is more organized and easier to understand, especially in larger projects where multiple enums with overlapping variant names might exist.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Type safety is a cornerstone of Rust's design, and enums are no exception. Rust treats enums as distinct types, meaning you cannot inadvertently assign a numeric value to an enum variable without an explicit cast. This type safety extends to ensuring that values of different enum types cannot be mixed without deliberate action. By enforcing these rules, Rust helps prevent a class of bugs related to type mismatches and unintended assignments, enhancing the reliability and maintainability of the code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Rust that works seamlessly with enums. Using the <code>match</code> statement, developers can destructure and handle enum variants in a concise and expressive manner. This pattern matching ensures that all possible cases are considered, which prevents runtime errors and enforces exhaustive checking at compile time. By requiring developers to address every potential variant, Rust's pattern matching contributes to writing more robust and error-free code, making it easier to manage complex logic tied to different enum values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this RPG example, the enum <code>Role</code> encapsulates different player roles. Functions like <code>describe_role</code> leverage Rust's pattern matching to operate based on the provided role, showcasing the straightforward and safe manipulation of enum types. Enums in Rust, by being true algebraic data types, provide a solid foundation for constructing robust applications with clear and concise type distinctions and handling.
</p>

### 11.3.3. Enumerations for Error Handling
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's approach to error handling fundamentally integrates with its type system through the use of enumerations, specifically with the <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types. These enums are essential tools in Rust for managing absence of values and handling recoverable errors in a safe and explicit manner.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>Option</code> enum is pivotal for scenarios where a value might be absent. It has two variants: <code>Some</code>, which wraps a value, and <code>None</code>, which indicates the absence of value. This explicit handling of absence through <code>Option</code> helps prevent common bugs associated with null values in other languages.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn find_index(needle: &str, haystack: &[&str]) -> Option<usize> {
    for (index, &item) in haystack.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == needle {
            return Some(index);
        }
    }
    None
}

// Usage
let items = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
match find_index("orange", &items) {
    Some(index) => println!("Found at index: {}", index),
    None => println!("Not found"),
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For error handling, Rust provides the <code>Result</code> enum, which is designed to return and propagate errors. <code>Result</code> has two variants: <code>Ok</code>, which indicates successful execution and contains a value, and <code>Err</code>, which contains an error. This design forces the handling of errors, ensuring that they do not go unchecked.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn divide(numerator: f32, denominator: f32) -> Result<f32, &'static str> {
    if denominator == 0.0 {
        Err("Cannot divide by zero.")
    } else {
        Ok(numerator / denominator)
    }
}

// Usage
match divide(10.0, 0.0) {
    Ok(result) => println!("Result: {}", result),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These enums integrate seamlessly with Rustâ€™s pattern matching, which not only makes the code more readable but also ensures that all possible cases are handled. The use of these enums in error handling exemplifies Rust's commitment to reliability and robustness in software design. Through <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code>, Rust encourages a more deliberate and error-resistant approach to programming, aligning with the language's overall philosophy towards safety and explicitness. This methodology significantly differs from the exception handling mechanisms in many other programming languages, providing Rust programs with a predictable and manageable error handling path.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion of this chapter, understanding and effectively utilizing structures and enumerations in Rust is crucial for harnessing the full potential of the language. These constructs provide powerful tools for organizing data, ensuring type safety, and leveraging Rustâ€™s robust memory management features. By mastering structs, unions, and enums, you will be well-equipped to write cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable code. This chapter has equipped you with the knowledge to define complex types, implement safe data handling, and employ pattern matching to handle diverse cases gracefully. As you continue to develop your Rust programming skills, these foundational elements will play a key role in crafting high-quality, maintainable software.
</p>

## 11.4. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When writing efficient and elegant code using structs, unions, and enums in Rust, itâ€™s essential to deeply understand their features and apply best practices to leverage Rustâ€™s safety and performance characteristics. Hereâ€™s an in-depth guide:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Structs are fundamental in Rust for grouping related data into a single type, making data management more coherent and manageable.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Defining Clear and Meaningful Structs:</strong> When defining structs, use descriptive names for both the struct and its fields. This clarity enhances code readability and maintenance. For example, instead of a generic <code>Data</code>, use <code>UserProfile</code> with fields like <code>username</code> and <code>email</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deriving Traits:</strong> Rust provides several useful traits that can be automatically derived for structs, such as <code>Debug</code>, <code>Clone</code>, <code>PartialEq</code>, and <code>Eq</code>. Use <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> to enable easy debugging and <code>#[derive(Clone)]</code> to support cloning without manually implementing it. For complex structs, manually implement traits when custom behavior is needed.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encapsulation of Logic:</strong> Implement methods associated with your struct to encapsulate behavior. Use <code>impl</code> blocks to define methods that operate on the structâ€™s data. This keeps logic related to the struct within its definition, promoting better organization and encapsulation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Memory Layout and Access Patterns:</strong> Be mindful of the memory layout of your structs. Rust stores struct fields in the order they are defined, which can impact cache performance. Frequently accessed fields should be placed earlier to enhance cache locality.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Using Tuple Structs:</strong> For lightweight data structures where field names are not necessary, tuple structs can be useful. They provide a simpler syntax and are suitable for cases where you only need positional access to data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Unions in Rust allow storing different types in the same memory space but require careful handling due to their complexity.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sparing Use of Unions:</strong> Unions are typically used in low-level system programming or performance-critical code where memory efficiency is paramount. They should be used only when absolutely necessary, as they bypass Rustâ€™s usual safety guarantees.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Managing Union Variants:</strong> Ensure that you only access the field that was most recently written to. Rust does not enforce which field is valid, so you must manually manage the state of the union. Consider using a combination of enums and unions to maintain safety.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Using Unsafe Code:</strong> Accessing union fields requires <code>unsafe</code> blocks. Ensure that you have rigorous checks and validation in place to guarantee that youâ€™re accessing valid data. Avoid <code>unsafe</code> code unless itâ€™s absolutely necessary, and document the invariants that the unsafe code assumes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Enums are a powerful feature in Rust that allows you to define a type that can be one of several variants, each of which may contain different data.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Modeling Domain Concepts:</strong> Use enums to represent a finite set of related values or states, enhancing code expressiveness. For instance, instead of using separate Boolean flags, use an enum like <code>OrderStatus</code> with variants like <code>Pending</code>, <code>Shipped</code>, and <code>Delivered</code> to represent different states clearly.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pattern Matching:</strong> Rustâ€™s <code>match</code> expression is highly effective with enums. Use pattern matching to handle different variants explicitly and exhaustively. This ensures that all possible cases are considered and can prevent errors. For instance, a <code>match</code> on an enum ensures that any new variants added later will be caught during compilation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enums with Associated Data:</strong> Each variant in an enum can hold different types and amounts of data. This allows you to create rich and flexible data models. Use enums with associated data to encapsulate and process different types of information in a single type.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementing Methods:</strong> You can implement methods for enums in the same way as structs, which can be useful for operations specific to particular variants. For example, you might have methods that only apply to certain variants and can be called safely on enums.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Combining Enums with Traits:</strong> For more complex behavior, combine enums with traits to define behavior that varies depending on the variant. This pattern can be used to create extensible and maintainable code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By deeply understanding and applying these practices for structs, unions, and enums, you can write Rust code that is both efficient and elegant, leveraging Rustâ€™s powerful type system and safety features to build robust and maintainable applications.
