<p style="text-align: justify;">
Chapter 8 of TRPL - "Types, Declaration, and Mutability" provides an in-depth exploration of Rust's type system, variable declaration, and mutability. It starts by covering the foundational elements of Rust, including its implementations and the basic source character set, and then details the various types in Rust, such as fundamental types, booleans, characters, integers, floating-point types, and their prefixes and suffixes, along with the void type, sizes, and alignment. The chapter explains the structure of declarations, how to declare multiple names, the concept of names and scope, and variable initialization. It introduces Rust's powerful type deduction features, such as <code>let</code> with type inference and type aliases, and distinguishes between objects and values, explaining lvalues and rvalues, and discusses object lifetimes to ensure memory safety. Additionally, it delves into Rust's approach to immutability, highlighting how default immutability enforces safe code practices and how to opt into mutability when necessary. Practical advice on best practices for using type aliases, structuring declarations effectively, and managing mutability provides a comprehensive understanding of these critical aspects of Rust programming.

## 8.1. The Rust Language Standard
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's language and standard library are defined by their official specifications and Rust RFCs (<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/">https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/</a>). In this book, references to these standards will be made as necessary. If any part of this book seems imprecise, incomplete, or potentially incorrect, consult the official Rust documentation. However, note that the documentation is not designed to serve as a tutorial or to be easily accessible for non-experts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Adhering strictly to Rust's language and library standards does not guarantee good or portable code. The standards only specify what a programmer can expect from an implementation. It is possible to write subpar code that conforms to the standard, and many practical programs rely on features not guaranteed to be portable by the standard. This reliance often occurs to access system interfaces and hardware features that Rust cannot directly express or that require specific implementation details.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Many essential aspects are defined as implementation-specific by the Rust standard. This means each implementation must provide a specific, well-documented behavior for a construct. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let c1: u8 = 64; // well-defined: u8 is always 8 bits and can hold 64
let c2: u8 = 1256; // implementation-defined: overflow wraps around
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The initialization of <code>c1</code> is well-defined because <code>u8</code> is always 8 bits. However, initializing <code>c2</code> is implementation-defined due to <code>u8</code> overflow behavior causing wrapping, where 1256 wraps to 232. Most implementation-defined features relate to hardware differences.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Other behaviors are unspecified, allowing a range of acceptable behaviors without requiring the implementer to specify which will occur. This is often due to the behavior being fundamentally unpredictable. For example, the exact value returned by <code>Box::new</code> is unspecified. Similarly, modifying a variable from multiple threads without proper synchronization results in unspecified behavior due to potential data races.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practical programming, relying on implementation-defined behavior is often necessary to operate effectively across various systems. While Rust would be simpler if all characters were 8 bits and all pointers 32 bits, different character and pointer sizes exist.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To enhance portability, it's wise to explicitly state which implementation-defined features are relied upon and to isolate these dependencies in clearly marked sections of the program. For instance, presenting all hardware size dependencies as constants and type definitions in a module is common. The standard library's <code>std::mem::size_of</code> supports such techniques. Many assumptions about implementation-defined features can be verified with compile-time assertions. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
const_assert!(std::mem::size_of::<i32>() >= 4, "size_of(i32) is too small");
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Undefined behavior is more severe. The Rust standard defines undefined behavior for constructs where no reasonable implementation behavior is required. Typically, using an undefined feature causes erratic program behavior. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
const SIZE: usize = 4 * 1024;
let mut page = vec![0; SIZE];
fn f() {
    page[SIZE + SIZE] = 7; // undefined behavior: out-of-bounds access
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Possible outcomes include overwriting unrelated data and triggering a runtime error. An implementation is not required to choose among plausible outcomes. With advanced optimizations, the effects of undefined behavior can become highly unpredictable. If plausible and easily implementable alternatives exist, a feature is classified as unspecified or implementation-defined rather than undefined.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is crucial to invest time and effort to ensure a program does not use unspecified or undefined features. Tools like the Rust compiler's built-in checks and external linters can assist in this process.
</p>

### 8.1.1. Implementations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust can be implemented in two primary ways: hosted or freestanding. A hosted implementation includes the full range of standard library features as outlined in the standard and this book. This means it provides comprehensive support for operating system interaction, file I/O, networking, concurrency, and other high-level abstractions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In contrast, a freestanding implementation is designed to operate without an underlying operating system, often in environments such as embedded systems or kernel development. As such, it may offer a reduced set of standard library features. Despite this, a freestanding implementation must still provide essential features to ensure basic functionality. These typically include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Core Functionality: Basic language constructs and features defined in the <code>core</code> library, which includes fundamental types, traits, and operations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Memory Management: Support for dynamic memory allocation, though the mechanisms may vary depending on the target environment.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Concurrency Primitives: Basic synchronization primitives if the target environment supports multi-threading.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Panic Handling: Mechanisms for handling panics, though they may be more constrained compared to hosted environments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The specifics of what a freestanding implementation must provide can vary, but the goal is to enable Rust programming in resource-constrained or specialized environments while maintaining the language's safety and performance guarantees.
</p>

{{< table "table-hover" >}}
| Freestanding Implementation Modules | Rust Modules |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| Types | std::ffi |
| Implementation properties | std::mem |
| Integer types | std::num |
| Start and termination | std::process |
| Dynamic memory management | std::alloc |
| Type identification | std::any |
| Exception handling | std::panic |
| Initializer lists | std::iter |
| Other run-time support | std::sync |
| Type traits | std::marker |
| Atomics | std::sync::atomic |
{{< /table >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Freestanding implementations are designed for environments with minimal operating system support. Many such implementations also offer options to exclude specific features, like panic handling, for extremely low-level, hardware-focused programs.
</p>

### 8.1.2. The Basic Source Character Set
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Rust language standard and the examples in this book utilize UTF-8 encoding, which encompasses letters, digits, graphical symbols, and whitespace characters from the Unicode character set. This can pose challenges for developers working in environments that use different character sets:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">UTF-8 Punctuation and Operator Symbols: UTF-8 includes a wide range of punctuation and operator symbols (such as <code>]</code>, <code>{</code>, and <code>!</code>), which might be absent in some older character sets. This discrepancy can cause issues when writing or reading source code in environments that do not support UTF-8 fully.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Representation of Non-Visual Characters: There needs to be a way to represent characters that don't have a straightforward visual representation, such as newline characters or characters with specific byte values. These characters are crucial for source code formatting and data representation but can be problematic in non-UTF-8 environments.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Support for Multilingual Characters: UTF-8 covers characters from virtually all written languages, unlike ASCII, which lacks characters used in non-English languages (such as <code>Ã±</code>, <code>Ãž</code>, and <code>Ã†</code>). This extensive coverage ensures that developers can write source code and comments in their native languages, improving readability and accessibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To support extended character sets in source code, programming environments can map these extended sets to the basic source character set in various ways, ensuring compatibility and proper display of all necessary characters. For example, environments can provide tools or settings to automatically convert non-UTF-8 characters to their UTF-8 equivalents, or they can offer visual aids to display non-representable characters in a recognizable way.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Rust RFC 2442, "Character Encodings for Source Code," outlines the guidelines for handling character encodings, emphasizing the importance of using UTF-8 to ensure that Rust source code is portable, readable, and maintainable across different environments. This RFC provides strategies for dealing with character encoding issues, such as specifying how source code should be interpreted and offering recommendations for tools and editors to support UTF-8 encoding consistently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Visual Studio Code (VS Code), one of the most popular code editors, has robust support for handling various character encodings, making it an excellent choice for working with Rust source code. By default, VS Code uses UTF-8 encoding for files, aligning perfectly with Rust's guidelines. This ensures that extended character sets are displayed correctly and that the source code remains compatible across different platforms and environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
VS Code offers several features to manage and convert file encodings seamlessly:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Automatic Encoding Detection: VS Code can automatically detect the encoding of a file when it is opened, ensuring that characters are displayed correctly without manual intervention.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Encoding Conversion: If a file is not in UTF-8, VS Code provides options to convert it. This can be done through the command palette (<code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> or <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code>), where you can select the "Change File Encoding" command. This allows you to re-save the file in UTF-8, ensuring compatibility with Rust's requirements.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Encoding Status Indicator: The status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window displays the current file encoding. Clicking on this indicator provides quick access to encoding conversion options, making it easy to switch to UTF-8 if needed.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Settings and Configuration: VS Code's settings allow you to configure default encodings for new files and to set preferences for handling file encodings. This can be particularly useful in ensuring consistency across all your Rust projects.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Extensions and Plugins: There are various extensions available for VS Code that enhance its encoding capabilities. These extensions can provide additional tools for managing character encodings, ensuring that your Rust source code adheres to the UTF-8 standard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By leveraging these features in VS Code, developers can ensure that their Rust source code meets the guidelines set forth in RFC 2442. This not only makes the code more portable and maintainable but also reduces the risk of encoding-related issues that could lead to bugs or misinterpretations of the code's intent.
</p>

## 8.2. Types
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following Rust code snippet:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let x = y + f(2);
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For this code to be valid in Rust, the variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and the function <code>f</code> must be appropriately declared. The programmer needs to ensure that these entities exist and that their types support the operations of assignment (<code>=</code>), addition (<code>+</code>), and function call (<code>()</code>), respectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Every identifier in a Rust program has an associated type, which determines what operations can be performed on it and how these operations are interpreted. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let mut x: f32; // x is a mutable floating-point variable
let y: i32 = 7; // y is an integer variable initialized to 7
fn f(arg: i32) -> f32 {
    // Function implementation goes here
    // This function takes an i32 argument and returns a floating-point number
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These declarations make the initial example valid. Since <code>y</code> is declared as an <code>i32</code>, it can be assigned and used as an operand for <code>+</code>. Similarly, <code>f</code> is declared as a function that accepts an <code>i32</code> argument, so it can be invoked with the integer <code>2</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This chapter introduces the fundamental types and declarations in Rust. The examples provided illustrate language features and are not intended for practical tasks. More detailed and realistic examples will be covered in subsequent sections. This chapter lays out the basic components from which Rust programs are built. Familiarity with these elements, along with the associated terminology and syntax, is crucial for developing Rust projects and understanding code written by others. However, a thorough grasp of every detail in this chapter is not necessary for comprehending the following chapters. You may choose to skim through this chapter to understand the main concepts and return later for a more detailed study as needed.
</p>

### 8.2.1. Fundamental Types
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust provides a variety of fundamental types that align with the basic storage units of a computer and the typical ways they are used to store data:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Boolean type (<code>bool</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Character type (<code>char</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Integer types (<code>i8</code>, <code>i16</code>, <code>i32</code>, <code>i64</code>, <code>i128</code>, <code>isize</code>, <code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>, <code>u128</code>, <code>usize</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Floating-point types (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Unit type (<code>()</code>) to represent the absence of a value</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
From these types, other types can be constructed using different declarator operators:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Pointer types (<code><strong>const T</code>, <code></strong>mut T</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Array types (<code>[T; N]</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Reference types (<code>&T</code>, <code>&mut T</code>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, Rust allows the creation of custom types:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Data structures (<code>struct</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Enumerations (<code>enum</code>) for specific sets of values</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Integral types include Boolean, character, and integer types. Together with floating-point types, these are known as arithmetic types. User-defined types like structs and enums are defined by the programmer, unlike built-in types which are inherently available. Fundamental types, pointers, and references are all categorized as built-in types. The Rust standard library also offers many user-defined types.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust provides integral and floating-point types in different sizes to give programmers options regarding storage consumption, precision, and computational range. The fundamental types in Rust, combined with pointers and arrays, present these low-level machine concepts to the programmer in a way that is largely platform-independent.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For most applications, <code>bool</code> is used for logical values, <code>char</code> for characters, <code>i32</code> or <code>i64</code> for integers, and <code>f32</code> or <code>f64</code> for floating-point numbers. The other fundamental types are designed for optimizations, specific requirements, and compatibility, and can be used as needed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Fundamental types in Rust are simpler and more elegant compared to C++ due to Rust's emphasis on safety, simplicity, and platform independence. Rust consolidates and standardizes its types, such as using a unified <code>bool</code> type for logical values and ensuring all character data is represented by a 4-byte Unicode scalar value <code>char</code>, which eliminates ambiguity and reduces the risk of errors. Unlike C++, which has multiple integer types with varying definitions and potential pitfalls, Rust's integer and floating-point types are consistently defined and straightforward to use. Rust's built-in types, including references and pointers, are designed with safety mechanisms like ownership and borrowing, which prevent common errors such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows. This coherent and streamlined approach, paired with Rust's focus on safety and concurrency, provides a simpler, more robust foundation for programming compared to the often complex and error-prone type system of C++.
</p>

### 8.2.2. Booleans
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, a Boolean type (<code>bool</code>) can have one of two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Booleans are used to represent the results of logical operations. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f(a: i32, b: i32) {
    let b1: bool = a == b;
    // ...
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are equal, <code>b1</code> will be <code>true</code>; otherwise, it will be <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<code>bool</code> is often used as the return type for functions that check a condition. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn is_open(file: &File) -> bool {
    // implementation here
}

fn greater(a: i32, b: i32) -> bool {
    a > b
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, <code>true</code> converts to the integer value <code>1</code>, and <code>false</code> converts to <code>0</code>. Similarly, integers can be explicitly converted to <code>bool</code> values: any nonzero integer converts to <code>true</code>, while <code>0</code> converts to <code>false</code>. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let b1: bool = 7 != 0; // b1 becomes true
let b2: bool = 7 != 0; // explicit check, b2 becomes true
let i1: i32 = true as i32; // i1 becomes 1
let i2: i32 = if true { 1 } else { 0 }; // i2 becomes 1
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To prevent implicit conversions and ensure explicit checks, you can use conditions like this:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f(i: i32) {
    let b: bool = i != 0;
    // ...
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In arithmetic and logical expressions, <code>bool</code>s are implicitly converted to integers (<code>true</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>false</code> to <code>0</code>). When converting back to <code>bool</code>, <code>0</code> becomes <code>false</code>, and any nonzero value becomes <code>true</code>. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let a: bool = true;
let b: bool = true;
let x: bool = (a as i32 + b as i32) != 0; // a + b is 2, so x becomes true
let y: bool = a || b; // a || b is true
let z: bool = (a as i32 - b as i32) == 0; // a - b is 0, so z becomes false
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, pointers can also be converted to <code>bool</code>. A non-null pointer converts to <code>true</code>, while a null pointer converts to <code>false</code>. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn g(p: *const i32) {
    let b: bool = !p.is_null(); // explicit null check
    if !p.is_null() {
        // ...
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using <code>if !p.is_null()</code> is preferred as it directly expresses "if p is valid" and is more concise, reducing the chance of errors.
</p>

### 8.2.3. Character Types
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust offers several character types to accommodate various character sets and encodings frequently used in programming:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>char</code>: The standard character type, representing a Unicode scalar value, always occupying 4 bytes.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>u8</code>: Typically used for ASCII characters, which are 8 bits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, <code>char</code> can hold any Unicode scalar value, while <code>u8</code> is used for 8-bit character sets like ASCII.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let ch: char = 'a';
    let byte: u8 = b'a';
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>ch</code> is a Unicode character, and <code>byte</code> is an 8-bit ASCII character.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's <code>char</code> type can store any valid Unicode character. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let ch = 'Ã¥';
    println!("The character is: {}", ch);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This will print the character <code>Ã¥</code> correctly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When dealing with different character sets and encodings, Rust's <code>char</code> type ensures each character is represented as a 4-byte Unicode scalar value, avoiding many issues associated with using different character sets and encodings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's a more complex example that prints the integer value of any character input:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() {
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    for ch in buffer.chars() {
        println!("The value of '{}' is {}", ch, ch as u32);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This program reads user input, converts each character to its integer value, and prints it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's character types are integral, allowing them to participate in arithmetic and bitwise operations. For example, to print the digits 0 through 9:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    for i in 0..10 {
        println!("{}", (b'0' + i) as char);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>b'0'</code> is the ASCII value for <code>0</code>, and adding <code>i</code> to it gives the next digit, which is then converted back to a <code>char</code> for printing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust manages character encoding and decoding through the <code>std::str</code> and <code>std::string</code> modules, providing strong support for working with text in multilingual and multi-character-set environments. This ensures your programs handle various character sets and encodings effectively and accurately.
</p>

### 8.2.4. Signed and Unsigned Characters
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the <code>char</code> type represents a Unicode scalar value and is always 4 bytes. For handling smaller character sets like ASCII, Rust provides the <code>u8</code> type. Rust avoids the issues found in C++ regarding whether a <code>char</code> is signed or unsigned, ensuring more predictable behavior. However, it is still important to handle conversions between different types with care.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following Rust code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let c: u8 = 255; // 255 is "all ones" in hexadecimal 0xFF
    let i: i32 = c as i32;
    println!("Value of i: {}", i);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case, <code>i</code> will always be 255 because <code>u8</code> is an unsigned 8-bit integer, and its value remains the same when converted to a larger integer type.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust ensures that different types are not mixed unintentionally. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f(c: u8, sc: i8) {
    // let pc: *const u8 = &sc; // error: mismatched types
    // let psc: *const i8 = &c; // error: mismatched types

    let i: i32 = c as i32; // explicitly convert u8 to i32
    let j: i32 = sc as i32; // explicitly convert i8 to i32
    println!("i: {}, j: {}", i, j);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Assigning values between different types is possible but must be done explicitly:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn g(c: u8, sc: i8) {
    let uc: u8 = sc as u8; // explicit conversion
    let signed_c: i8 = c as i8; // explicit conversion
    println!("uc: {}, signed_c: {}", uc, signed_c);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's a concrete example where a <code>char</code> is 8 bits in size:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let sc: i8 = -60;
    let uc: u8 = sc as u8; // uc == 196 (because 256 - 60 == 196)
    println!("uc: {}", uc);

    let mut count = [0; 256];
    count[sc as usize] += 1; // careful with negative indices
    count[uc as usize] += 1;
    println!("Count: {:?}", &count[..10]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using <code>u8</code> and explicit type conversions in Rust prevents many of the potential issues and confusions associated with C++'s signed and unsigned <code>char</code> types. By handling type conversions explicitly and safely, Rust ensures that your programs behave predictably and correctly.
</p>

### 8.2.5. Character Literals
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Character literals are single characters enclosed in single quotes, such as <code>'a'</code> and <code>'0'</code>. The type of these literals is <code>char</code>, which represents a Unicode scalar value, allowing for a broad range of characters. For instance, the character <code>'0'</code> has the integer value <code>48</code> in ASCII. Using character literals instead of numeric values enhances the portability of your code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Special escape sequences for certain characters use the backslash (<code>\</code>) as an escape character:
</p>

{{< table "table-hover" >}}
| Name | Escape Sequence |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| Newline | \\n |
| Horizontal tab | \\t |
| Vertical tab | \\u{000B} |
| Backspace | \\u{0008} |
| Carriage return | \\r |
| Form feed | \\u{000C} |
| Alert | \\u{0007} |
| Backslash | \\\\ |
| Single quote | \\' |
| Double quote | \\" |
| Unicode code point | \\u{hhhh} |
{{< /table >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These sequences represent individual characters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Characters can be represented using different numeric notations. Characters from the character set can be represented as one, two, or three-digit octal numbers (preceded by <code>\</code>) or as hexadecimal numbers (preceded by <code>\x</code>). These sequences are terminated by the first non-digit character. For example:
</p>

{{< table "table-hover" >}}
| Octal | Hexadecimal | Decimal | ASCII |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| '\\6' | '\\x6' | 6 | ACK |
| '\\60' | '\\x30' | 48 | '0' |
| '\\137' | '\\x5f' | 95 | '\_' |
{{< /table >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These notations allow you to represent any character in the system's character set, making it possible to embed such characters in strings. However, using numeric notations for characters can make a program less portable across different systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Character literals should be single characters, and using more than one character in a character literal is not supported, unlike in C++. The language uses <code>char</code> for single characters and <code>&str</code> for strings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When embedding numeric constants in strings using octal notation, it is advisable to use three digits to avoid confusion. For hexadecimal constants, use two digits. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let v1 = "a\x0ah\x129"; // 6 chars: 'a', '\x0a', 'h', '\x12', '9', '\0'
    let v2 = "a\x0ah\x127"; // 5 chars: 'a', '\x0a', 'h', '\x7f', '\0'
    let v3 = "a\xad\x127";  // 4 chars: 'a', '\xad', '\x7f', '\0'
    let v4 = "a\xad\x0127"; // 5 chars: 'a', '\xad', '\x01', '2', '7', '\0'

    println!("v1: {}", v1);
    println!("v2: {}", v2);
    println!("v3: {}", v3);
    println!("v4: {}", v4);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The language supports Unicode and can handle character sets much richer than the ASCII set. Unicode literals are represented using Unicode escape sequences like <code>\u</code> or <code>\U</code>. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let unicode_char1 = '\u{FADE}'; // Unicode character U+FADE
    let unicode_char2 = '\u{DEAD}'; // Unicode character U+DEAD
    let unicode_char3 = '\xAD';     // ASCII character with hex value AD

    println!("unicode_char1: {}", unicode_char1);
    println!("unicode_char2: {}", unicode_char2);
    println!("unicode_char3: {}", unicode_char3);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The shorter notation <code>\u{XXXX}</code> is equivalent to <code>\U{0000XXXX}</code> for any hexadecimal digit. This ensures that characters are handled correctly according to the Unicode standard, making the program more portable and robust across different environments.
</p>

### 8.2.6. Integer Types
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similar to characters, integer types come in different forms: <code>i32</code> for signed integers and <code>u32</code> for unsigned integers. Various integer types are available in multiple sizes: <code>i8</code>, <code>i16</code>, <code>i32</code>, <code>i64</code>, and <code>i128</code> for signed integers, and <code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>, and <code>u128</code> for unsigned integers. These types offer precise control over the number of bits used and whether the values are signed or unsigned.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Unsigned integer types are ideal for treating storage as a bit array. However, using an unsigned type just to gain one extra bit for representing positive integers is generally not advisable. Attempts to ensure that values remain positive by using unsigned types can often be undermined by implicit conversions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
All plain integers are signed. For more detailed control over integer sizes, fixed-size types such as <code>i64</code> for a signed 64-bit integer and <code>u64</code> for an unsigned 64-bit integer can be used. These types guarantee specific bit sizes and are not merely synonyms for other types.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to standard integer types, extended integer types may be provided. These types behave like integers but offer a larger range and occupy more space, useful for specific applications requiring higher precision or larger value ranges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By using these integer types, precise control over data size and representation is ensured, leading to more efficient and reliable programs.
</p>

### 8.2.7. Integer Literals
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Integer literals can be written in three formats: decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. Decimal literals are the most commonly used and appear as expected: <code>7</code>, <code>1234</code>, <code>976</code>, <code>12345678901234567890</code> Compilers should warn about literals that exceed the maximum representable size, although errors are guaranteed only in specific contexts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Literals starting with <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> denote hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, while those starting with <code>0</code> and not followed by <code>x</code> or <code>X</code> denote octal (base 8) numbers. For example:
</p>

{{< table "table-hover" >}}
| Decimal | Octal | Hexadecimal |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0x0 |
| 2 | 02 | 0x2 |
| 63 | 077 | 0x3f |
| 83 | 0123 | 0x63 |
{{< /table >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The letters <code>a</code> to <code>f</code>, or their uppercase counterparts, represent the values 10 to 15 in hexadecimal notation. Octal and hexadecimal notations are useful for expressing bit patterns. However, using these notations for numerical values can sometimes be misleading. For instance, on a system where <code>i16</code> is represented as a two's complement 16-bit integer, <code>0xffff</code> would be interpreted as the negative decimal number <code>-1</code>. With more bits, it would be the positive decimal number <code>65535</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Suffixes can specify the type of integer literals explicitly. The suffix <code>u</code> indicates an unsigned literal, while <code>i64</code> indicates a 64-bit integer. For example, <code>3</code> is an <code>i32</code> by default, <code>3u</code> is a <code>u32</code>, and <code>3i64</code> is an <code>i64</code>. Combinations of these suffixes are also permitted.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
If no suffix is provided, the compiler assigns an appropriate type to the integer literal based on its value and the available integer types' sizes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To maintain code clarity and readability, it is recommended to limit the use of obscure constants to a few well-documented <code>const</code>, <code>static</code>, or <code>enum</code> initializers.
</p>

### 8.2.8. Types of Integer Literals
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The type of an integer literal is determined by its form, value, and suffix:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">For decimal literals with no suffix, the type will be the first that can hold its value: <code>i32</code>, <code>i64</code>, <code>i128</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">For octal or hexadecimal literals with no suffix, the type will be the first that can hold its value: <code>i32</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>i64</code>, <code>u64</code>, <code>i128</code>, <code>u128</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">If the literal has a <code>u</code> or <code>U</code> suffix, it will be the first type that can hold its value: <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>, <code>u128</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Decimal literals with an <code>i64</code> suffix will be of type <code>i64</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Octal or hexadecimal literals with an <code>i64</code> suffix will be the first type that can hold its value: <code>i64</code>, <code>u64</code>, <code>i128</code>, <code>u128</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Literals with suffixes like <code>u64</code>, <code>u128</code>, or similar will be the first type that can hold their value: <code>u64</code>, <code>u128</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Decimal literals with an <code>i128</code> suffix will be of type <code>i128</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Octal or hexadecimal literals with an <code>i128</code> suffix will be the first type that can hold their value: <code>i128</code>, <code>u128</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Literals with suffixes like <code>u128</code> will be of type <code>u128</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For instance, the literal <code>100000</code> is <code>i32</code> on a system with 32-bit integers but becomes <code>i64</code> on systems where <code>i32</code> can't represent that value. Similarly, <code>0xA000</code> is <code>i32</code> on a 32-bit system but <code>u32</code> if <code>i32</code> is too small. To avoid such issues, suffixes can be used: <code>100000i64</code> ensures the type is <code>i64</code>, and <code>0xA000u32</code> ensures the type is <code>u32</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using suffixes helps maintain consistency and avoids potential problems with type size and representation across different systems.
</p>

### 8.2.9. Floating-Point Types
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Floating-point types in Rust are used to represent numbers with decimal points and approximate real numbers within a fixed memory allocation. The Rust language defines three primary floating-point types:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>f32</code> (Single-Precision Floating-Point): Provides approximately 7 decimal digits of precision and uses 32 bits of memory. It is suitable for applications where memory usage is a critical concern and where high precision is less critical.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>f64</code> (Double-Precision Floating-Point): Provides approximately 15 decimal digits of precision and uses 64 bits of memory. It is the default choice for most floating-point operations in Rust due to its better precision and wider range compared to <code>f32</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>f128</code> (Extended-Precision Floating-Point): While <code>f128</code> is supported in some implementations for even higher precision, its availability and behavior can vary depending on the platform and the specific Rust implementation. It provides greater precision than <code>f64</code>, but it is not universally available or standardized across all environments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The definitions of these precision levels can vary slightly depending on the hardware and compiler implementations. In general, floating-point arithmetic is subject to rounding errors and precision limitations due to the way numbers are represented in binary format.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Choosing the right level of precision involves balancing accuracy and performance:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">For most applications, <code>f64</code> is recommended as the default because it provides a good compromise between precision and performance. It ensures sufficient accuracy for most numerical computations while avoiding the potential pitfalls of lower precision types.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">For applications with stringent memory constraints or where absolute precision is less critical, <code>f32</code> might be used. It requires less memory and can be faster in computations due to its smaller size, but it comes with reduced precision.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">For specialized applications requiring very high precision beyond <code>f64</code>, <code>f128</code> can be considered, provided the Rust implementation and hardware support it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you are not familiar with floating-point arithmetic, it is advisable to:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Consult an Expert: Seek guidance from experts in numerical computing to understand the implications of different precision levels.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Educate Yourself: Dedicate time to learning about floating-point arithmetic, including how it affects calculations and potential pitfalls such as rounding errors and precision loss.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Default to <code>f64</code>: In many cases, using <code>f64</code> as the default choice provides a reasonable balance between accuracy and performance and avoids many common issues associated with floating-point calculations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding these aspects ensures that you can make informed decisions about floating-point precision based on the specific needs and constraints of your application. Floating-point arithmetic in Rust offers several advantages over C++ primarily due to Rust's strong emphasis on safety and simplicity. Rust's type system enforces strict type checking, reducing the risk of type-related errors that can occur with floating-point operations. Additionally, Rust's robust handling of undefined behavior ensures that floating-point operations are safer by default, preventing issues like uninitialized memory access which can be problematic in C++. Rust also provides clear and consistent definitions for its floating-point types (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>), ensuring predictable behavior across different platforms. This consistency, combined with Rust's powerful compiler and error-checking capabilities, helps developers avoid common pitfalls associated with floating-point arithmetic, such as rounding errors and precision loss. Moreover, Rust's default to <code>f64</code> for most floating-point operations simplifies decision-making for developers, providing a sensible balance between precision and performance without the need for extensive configuration. These features collectively make Rust's approach to floating-point arithmetic more user-friendly and reliable compared to C++.
</p>

### 8.2.10. Floating-Point Literals
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, floating-point literals are interpreted as type <code>f64</code> by default, which provides double-precision floating-point representation. This means literals such as <code>1.23</code>, <code>.23</code>, <code>0.23</code>, <code>1.0</code>, and <code>1.2e10</code> are treated as <code>f64</code> unless explicitly specified otherwise. The default behavior ensures that most floating-point calculations benefit from the greater precision of <code>f64</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is important to adhere to syntax rules for floating-point literals. Specifically, spaces are not allowed within a floating-point literal. For example, <code>65.43 eâˆ’21</code> is invalid and will result in a syntax error because Rust interprets it as separate tokens. The correct format would be <code>65.43e-21</code>, with no spaces between the number and the exponent.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To specify a floating-point literal of type <code>f32</code>, which provides single-precision, you should use the suffix <code>f</code> or <code>F</code>. For instance, <code>3.14159265f</code>, <code>2.0f</code>, <code>2.997925F</code>, and <code>2.9e-3f</code> denote <code>f32</code> literals. These suffixes explicitly denote the desired precision and help avoid unintentional precision loss.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similarly, to define a floating-point literal of type <code>f128</code>, which offers extended precision, the suffix <code>L</code> should be used. Examples include <code>3.14159265L</code>, <code>2.0L</code>, <code>2.997925L</code>, and <code>2.9e-3L</code>. Using the <code>L</code> suffix ensures that the literal is treated with the appropriate extended precision.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Compilers are expected to provide warnings if floating-point literals exceed the representable size of the specified type, helping to prevent potential issues with precision or overflow. By following these conventions and using appropriate suffixes, you can ensure that your floating-point literals are accurate and consistent across different platforms and implementations, enhancing both precision and type safety in your Rust programs.
</p>

## 8.3. Prefixes and Suffixes
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There is a range of prefixes and suffixes used to specify the types of literals. Hereâ€™s a summary:
</p>

{{< table "table-hover" >}}
| Notation | Position | Meaning | Example |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 0 | prefix | octal | 0776 |
| 0x, 0X | prefix | hexadecimal | 0xff |
| u, U | suffix | unsigned | 10U |
| l, L | suffix | long | 20000L |
| ll, LL | suffix | long long | 20000LL |
| f, F | suffix | float | 10f |
| e, E | infix | floating-point exponent | 10eâˆ’4 |
| . | infix | floating-point decimal | 12.3 |
| ' | prefix | char | 'c' |
| u' | prefix | char16_t | u'c' |
| U' | prefix | char32_t | U'c' |
| L' | prefix | wchar_t | L'c' |
| " | prefix | string literal | "mess" |
| R" | prefix | raw string | R"(\\b)" |
| u8", u8R" | prefix | UTF-8 string | u8"foo" |
| u", uR" | prefix | UTF-16 string | u"foo" |
| U", UR" | prefix | UTF-32 string | U"foo" |
| L", LR" | prefix | `wchar_t` string | L"foo" |
{{< /table >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Suffixes <code>l</code> and <code>L</code> can be combined with <code>u</code> and <code>U</code> to specify unsigned long types. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
1LU // unsigned long
2UL // unsigned long
3ULL // unsigned long long
4LLU // unsigned long long
5LUL // error
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The suffixes <code>l</code> and <code>L</code> can be used for floating-point literals to denote long double. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
1L // long int
1.0L // long double
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Combinations of <code>R</code>, <code>L</code>, and <code>u</code> prefixes are also allowed, such as <code>uR"<strong></strong>(foo\(bar))<strong></strong>"</code>. Note the significant difference between a <code>U</code> prefix for a character (unsigned) and for a string (UTF-32 encoding).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
You can also define new suffixes for user-defined types. For example, by creating a user-defined literal operator, you can have:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
"foo bar"s // a literal of type std::string
123_km // a literal of type Distance
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Suffixes not starting with <code>_</code> are reserved for the standard library.
</p>

## 8.4. void
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the concept of <code>void</code> as seen in some other languages does not exist. Instead, Rust uses more explicit types and constructs to handle scenarios where a function does not return a value or where a pointer might be to an unknown type.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the absence of a return value from a function is represented by the <code>()</code> type, often referred to as the unit type. The unit type <code>()</code> signifies that a function does not return any meaningful value. For instance, a function that performs an action without returning a value is defined with <code>()</code> as its return type:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f() -> () {
    // Function body
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Alternatively, in Rust, <code>()</code> can be omitted in function signatures when the return type is <code>()</code> by default:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f() {
    // Function body
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For handling pointers to unknown or generic types, Rust uses references and raw pointers rather than a concept like <code>void<strong></code> from other languages. Specifically, Rust provides <code></strong>const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code> for immutable and mutable raw pointers, respectively, where <code>T</code> can be any type, allowing for a form of type-erasure in pointers:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let ptr: *const u8; // A raw pointer to an unknown type
let mut_ptr: *mut i32; // A mutable raw pointer to a specific type
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust does not allow the creation of references or variables of the <code>void</code> type directly, as <code>void</code> itself is not a valid type in Rust. Instead, Rust's approach is designed to avoid the ambiguities and potential issues associated with <code>void</code> in other languages, providing more precise and safer type handling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, Rust replaces the concept of <code>void</code> with the unit type <code>()</code>, and uses explicit type annotations and raw pointers to handle cases where types are unknown or not applicable. This approach maintains clarity and type safety while avoiding the pitfalls associated with <code>void</code> in other programming languages.
</p>

## 8.5. Sizes
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The sizes of fundamental types, such as integers, can vary between implementations, making it essential to recognize and address these dependencies. While developers working on a single system might not prioritize portability, this view is narrow. Programs often need to be ported or compiled with different compilers on the same system, and future compiler updates might introduce variations. Handling these implementation-dependent issues during development is far more manageable than resolving them later.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Minimizing the impact of these dependencies is typically more straightforward for language features but can be more challenging for system-dependent library functions. Utilizing standard library features whenever possible is advisable to reduce these challenges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust provides different integer and floating-point types to leverage underlying hardware characteristics. On various systems, fundamental types may differ significantly in memory requirements, access times, and computational performance. Selecting the appropriate type for a variable can enhance performance if the system's characteristics are well understood. However, writing portable low-level code remains complex and requires careful consideration of these differences.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A plausible set of fundamental types and a sample string literal might look like this:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
char 'a'
bool true
i8 56
i16 1234
i32 100000000
i64 1234567890
i128 1234567890
&str "Hello, world!"
f32 1.234567e34
f64 1.234567e34
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, object sizes are expressed in terms of multiples of the size of a <code>u8</code> (byte), meaning the size of a <code>u8</code> is defined as 1 byte. To determine the size of an object or type, you can use the <code>size_of</code> function from the <code>std::mem</code> module. The guarantees about the sizes of fundamental types are as follows:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">The size of <code>u8</code> is 1 byte, and sizes of other integer types increase accordingly: <code>size_of::<u8>() <= size_of::<i8>() <= size_of::<i16>() <= size_of::<i32>() <= size_of::<i64>() <= size_of::<i128>()</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The size of <code>bool</code> is at least as large as <code>u8</code> but not necessarily larger than <code>i64</code>: <code>1 <= size_of::<bool>() <= size_of::<i64>()</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The size of <code>char</code> is guaranteed to be at least as large as <code>u8</code>: <code>size_of::<u8>() <= size_of::<char>()</code>.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The size of <code>f32</code> is guaranteed to be less than or equal to <code>f64</code>: <code>size_of::<f32>() <= size_of::<f64>()</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
While a <code>u8</code> is guaranteed to be at least 8 bits, <code>i16</code> at least 16 bits, and <code>i32</code> at least 32 bits, making assumptions beyond these guarantees can lead to non-portable code. For example, assuming the size of an <code>i32</code> is equivalent to a pointer size is not safe, as pointers may be larger than integers on many 64-bit architectures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use <code>size_of</code> to find the sizes and limits of various types:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::mem;
use std::i32;
use std::u8;

fn main() {
    println!("Size of i32: {}", mem::size_of::<i32>());
    println!("Size of i64: {}", mem::size_of::<i64>());
    println!("Max i32: {}", i32::MAX);
    println!("Min i32: {}", i32::MIN);
    println!("Is u8 signed? {}", u8::MIN < 0);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The functions in the standard library often perform checks without runtime overhead and can be used in constant contexts. Fundamental types can be mixed in expressions, with attempts to preserve value accuracy where possible.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For specific integer sizes, use types defined in the <code>std::num</code> module. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x: i16 = 0xaabb; // 2 bytes
let y: i64 = 0xaaaabbbbccccdddd; // 8 bytes
let z: usize = 10; // size type for array indexing
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The standard library defines <code>usize</code> for sizes and <code>isize</code> for pointer differences, ensuring they fit the architecture's needs.
</p>

## 8.6. Alignment
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, objects require not only sufficient storage for their data but also proper alignment to ensure efficient or even possible access on specific hardware architectures. For example, a 4-byte integer typically needs to be aligned on a 4-byte boundary, while an 8-byte floating-point number might need to be aligned on an 8-byte boundary. Alignment requirements are highly implementation-specific and are often implicit for most developers. Many programmers can work effectively without explicitly managing alignment issues until they encounter object layout problems, where structures may include "padding" to maintain proper alignment.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>align_of</code> function from the <code>std::mem</code> module returns the alignment requirement of a given type. For example, you can determine the alignment of various types as follows:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::mem;

let align_char = mem::align_of::<char>(); // Alignment of a char
let align_i32 = mem::align_of::<i32>();  // Alignment of an i32
let align_f64 = mem::align_of::<f64>();  // Alignment of a double
let array = [0i32; 20];
let align_array = mem::align_of_val(&array);  // Alignment of an array of i32
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In cases where explicit alignment is necessary, and where expressions like <code>align_of(x + y)</code> are not supported, the <code>#[repr(align)]</code> attribute can be used to specify alignment requirements in Rust. For example, to allocate uninitialized storage for a type <code>X</code> with a specific alignment, you can use the <code>MaybeUninit</code> type as follows:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};

#[repr(align(4))]
struct AlignedX {
    x: X,
}

fn process_vector(vx: &Vec<X>) {
    const BUFMAX: usize = 1024;
    let mut buffer: [MaybeUninit<AlignedX>; BUFMAX] = unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() };
    let max = std::cmp::min(vx.len(), BUFMAX / mem::size_of::<X>());
    for (i, item) in vx.iter().take(max).enumerate() {
        buffer[i] = MaybeUninit::new(AlignedX { x: *item });
    }
    // Use buffer here...
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>AlignedX</code> ensures that the <code>x</code> field is properly aligned, while <code>MaybeUninit</code> allows for uninitialized storage, providing explicit control over alignment when necessary.
</p>

## 8.7. Declarations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Before an identifier can be used in a Rust program, it must be declared. This involves specifying its type so the compiler understands what kind of entity the name refers to. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let ch: char;
let s: String;
let count = 1;
const PI: f64 = 3.1415926535897;
static mut ERROR_NUMBER: i32 = 0;
let name: &str = "Njal";
let seasons = ["spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"];
let people: Vec<&str> = vec![name, "Skarphedin", "Gunnar"];
struct Date { d: i32, m: i32, y: i32 }
fn day(p: &Date) -> i32 { p.d }
fn sqrt(x: f64) -> f64 { x.sqrt() }
fn abs<T: PartialOrd + Copy>(a: T) -> T { if a < T::zero() { -a } else { a } }
const fn fac(n: i32) -> i32 { if n < 2 { 1 } else { n * fac(n - 1) } }
const ZZ: i32 = fac(7);
type Cmplx = num::Complex<f64>;
enum Beer { Carlsberg, Tuborg, Thor }
mod ns { pub static mut A: i32 = 0; }
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These examples show that a declaration does more than just associate a type with a name. Most declarations also serve as definitions, providing all necessary information for using an entity within a program. Definitions allocate memory for the entities they represent, whereas declarations merely inform the compiler of the entity's type.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, assuming these declarations are in the global scope:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>let ch: char;</code> allocates memory for a character but does not initialize it.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>let count = 1;</code> allocates memory for an integer initialized to 1.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>let name: &str = "Njal";</code> allocates memory for a string slice pointing to the string literal "Njal".</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>struct Date { d: i32, m: i32, y: i32 }</code> defines a struct with three integer members.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>fn day(p: &Date) -> i32 { p.d }</code> defines a function that returns the day from a <code>Date</code> struct.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>type Point = num::Complex<i16>;</code> defines a type alias for <code>num::Complex<i16></code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Only three of the above declarations are not definitions:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>fn sqrt(x: f64) -> f64;</code> declares a function signature without providing a body.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>static mut ERROR_NUMBER: i32;</code> declares a mutable static variable.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>struct User;</code> declares a type name without defining its structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each name in a Rust program must have exactly one definition, although multiple declarations are allowed. All declarations of an entity must agree on its type. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let count: i32;
let count: i32 = 1; // error: redefinition

static mut ERROR_NUMBER: i32;
static mut ERROR_NUMBER: i32; // OK: redeclaration

fn day(p: &Date) -> i32 { p.d }
const PI: f64 = 3.1415926535897;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, only two definitions do not specify values:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let ch: char;
let s: String;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These principles ensure that all entities in a Rust program are properly declared and defined, promoting type safety and preventing errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Please note that in Rust, declaration and definition serve distinct purposes. A declaration introduces a variable, function, or type to the compiler, indicating its existence and type but not allocating or initializing any storage. For example, declaring a function with <code>fn my_func();</code> specifies that <code>my_func</code> exists but does not provide its implementation. In contrast, a definition provides the complete implementation or initialization. For instance, defining <code>fn my_func() { /<strong> implementation </strong>/ }</code> not only declares the function but also specifies its behavior. Similarly, defining a variable with <code>let x = 10;</code> initializes <code>x</code> with the value <code>10</code>, whereas declaring it with <code>let x: i32;</code> only informs the compiler of its type without assigning a value. Thus, declarations lay the groundwork for use, while definitions supply the necessary details for functionality.
</p>

### 8.7.1. The Structure of Declarations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The structure of a declaration follows a clear and concise syntax. Typically, a declaration consists of:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Optional visibility specifiers (e.g., <code>pub</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">A binding (e.g., <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, or <code>static</code>)</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">A name</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">An optional type annotation</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">An optional initializer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a declaration of an array of strings:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
const KINGS: [&str; 3] = ["Antigonus", "Seleucus", "Ptolemy"];
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>const</code> is the binding, <code>KINGS</code> is the name, <code>[&str; 3]</code> is the type annotation, and <code>["Antigonus", "Seleucus", "Ptolemy"]</code> is the initializer.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A specifier can be an initial keyword like <code>pub</code>, indicating the visibility of the item being declared.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A declarator includes the name of the variable or function and can optionally include type annotations. Some common declarator forms are:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Prefix <code>*</code> for raw pointers</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Prefix <code>&</code> for references</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Suffix <code>[]</code> for arrays</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Suffix <code>()</code> for function calls</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The syntax for pointers, arrays, and functions is straightforward, for example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let ptr: *const i32; // raw pointer to an integer
let slice: &[i32]; // reference to a slice of integers
let func: fn(i32) -> i32; // function pointer taking an i32 and returning an i32
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Types must always be specified clearly in a declaration. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
const C: i32 = 7;
fn gt(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    if a > b { a } else { b }
}
let ui: u32;
let li: i64;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Explicit type annotations prevent subtle errors and confusion that might arise from implicit type assumptions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here is a table summarizing some of the common declarator operators and their use:
</p>

{{< table "table-hover" >}}
| Declarator Operator | Meaning |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| `*` (prefix) | raw pointer |
| `&` (prefix) | reference |
| `[]` (suffix) | array |
| `()` (suffix) | function call |
{{< /table >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By using these declarator operators, type safety and clarity in code are ensured, making it easier to read and maintain.
</p>

### 8.7.2. Declaring Multiple Names
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Multiple variables can be declared in a single statement using a comma-separated list. However, care should be taken to maintain readability and clarity. For instance, two integers can be declared like this:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let (x, y): (i32, i32) = (0, 0);
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When dealing with pointers or references, the operators apply only to the specific variable they precede, not to subsequent variables in the same declaration. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let (p, y): (*const i32, i32) = (std::ptr::null(), 0); // p is a pointer, y is an integer
let (x, q): (i32, *const i32) = (0, std::ptr::null()); // x is an integer, q is a pointer
let (v, pv): ([i32; 10], *const i32) = ([0; 10], std::ptr::null()); // v is an array, pv is a pointer
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
While declaring multiple variables in one line is possible, it can reduce code readability, especially with complex types. Therefore, it's often better to declare each variable separately for clarity:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x: i32 = 0;
let y: i32 = 0;

let p: *const i32 = std::ptr::null();
let y: i32 = 0;

let x: i32 = 0;
let q: *const i32 = std::ptr::null();

let v: [i32; 10] = [0; 10];
let pv: *const i32 = std::ptr::null();
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This method ensures each variable's type and initial value are clear, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
</p>

## 8.8. Names
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A name (identifier) consists of a sequence of letters and digits, with the first character being a letter. The underscore character, \_, is considered a letter. Rust does not impose a limit on the number of characters in a name. However, some parts of an implementation may have restrictions due to runtime environment or linker constraints. Keywords like <code>fn</code> or <code>let</code> cannot be used as names for user-defined entities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here are some examples of valid names:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
hello
this_is_a_very_long_identifier
DEFINED
foO
bAr
u_name
HorseSense
var0
var1
CLASS
_class
___
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Examples of invalid names include:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
012
a fool
$sys
class
3var
pay.due
fooËœbar
.name
if
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Names starting with an underscore are reserved for special facilities in the implementation and runtime environment, and should not be used in application programs. Names starting with a double underscore (\_\_) or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter (e.g., \_Foo) are also reserved.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The compiler always reads the longest possible string of characters that could form a name. Hence, <code>var10</code> is one name, not <code>var</code> followed by <code>10</code>. Similarly, <code>elseif</code> is one name, not the keywords <code>else</code> and <code>if</code>. Uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct, so <code>Count</code> and <code>count</code> are different names, but it's often unwise to use names that differ only by capitalization. In general, avoid names that are only subtly different. For instance, in some fonts, the uppercase "O" and zero "0" are hard to distinguish, as are the lowercase "L", uppercase "I", and one "1". Therefore, names like <code>l0</code>, <code>lO</code>, <code>l1</code>, <code>ll</code>, and <code>I1l</code> are poor choices. Although not all fonts have the same issues, most have some.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Names in a large scope should be relatively long and clear, such as <code>vector</code>, <code>WindowWithBorder</code>, and <code>DepartmentNumber</code>. In contrast, names used in a small scope can be short and conventional, like <code>x</code>, <code>i</code>, and <code>p</code>. Functions, structs, and modules help keep scopes small. Frequently used names should be short, while less frequently used entities can have longer names.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Choose names that reflect the meaning of an entity rather than its implementation. For example, <code>phone_book</code> is better than <code>number_vector</code>, even if the phone numbers are stored in a vector. Avoid encoding type information in names (e.g., <code>pcname</code> for a <code>char*</code> or <code>icount</code> for an <code>int</code>) as is sometimes done in languages with dynamic or weak type systems:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Encoding types in names lowers the abstraction level of the program and prevents generic programming, which relies on names being able to refer to entities of different types.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The compiler is better at tracking types than a programmer.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Changing the type of a name would require changing every use of the name, or the type encoding would become misleading.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Any system of type abbreviations will eventually become overcomplicated and cryptic as the variety of types increases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Choosing good names is an art. Maintain a consistent naming style. For instance, capitalize user-defined type names and start non-type names with a lowercase letter (e.g., <code>Shape</code> and <code>current_token</code>). Use all capitals for macros (if used, e.g., <code>HACK</code>) and never for non-macros. Use underscores to separate words in an identifier; <code>number_of_elements</code> is more readable than <code>numberOfElements</code>. However, consistency can be difficult because programs often combine fragments from different sources, each with its own style. Be consistent with abbreviations and acronyms. The language and standard library use lowercase for types, which indicates they are part of the standard.
</p>

## 8.9. Keywords
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust includes a set of reserved keywords that are essential to the language's syntax and cannot be used as identifiers for variables, functions, or other entities. Here is a list of Rust keywords:
</p>

{{< table "table-hover" >}}
| as | break | const | continue | crate | extern |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| false | fn | for | if | impl | in |
| let | loop | match | mod | move | mut |
| pub | ref | return | self | Self | static |
| struct | super | trait | true | type | unsafe |
| use | where | while | async | await | dyn |
{{< /table >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition, Rust reserves a few keywords for potential future use to ensure forward compatibility:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">abstract \[\[cite:</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">become</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">box</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">do</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">final</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">macro</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">override</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">priv</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">try</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">typeof</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">unsized</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">virtual</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">yield</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These reserved keywords ensure that the language maintains a clear and unambiguous syntax. Using any of these keywords as identifiers will result in a compilation error, helping to avoid confusion and potential bugs in the code, and ensuring that the code remains readable and maintainable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When writing Rust code, it is crucial to follow these rules and avoid using reserved keywords for naming variables, functions, or types. Instead, select meaningful names that accurately reflect the purpose and role of each entity within your program. This practice not only prevents syntax errors but also enhances code clarity and maintainability.
</p>

## 8.10. Scopes
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A declaration introduces a name into a particular scope, meaning the name can only be used within that designated part of the code.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Local scope:</strong> A name declared inside a function or closure is considered a local name. Its scope extends from the point of declaration to the end of the block in which it's declared. Parameters of functions or closures are considered local names within their outermost block.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Struct scope:</strong> A name defined within a struct but outside any function or block is called a struct member name. Its scope extends from the opening <code>{</code> of the struct declaration to the end of the struct declaration.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Module scope:</strong> A name defined within a module but outside any function, closure, struct, or other namespace is called a module member name. Its scope extends from the point of declaration to the end of the module. A module name may also be accessible from other modules.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Crate scope:</strong> A name defined outside any function, struct, enum, or module is considered a global name. The scope of a global name extends from the point of declaration to the end of the file in which it is declared. A global name may also be accessible from other crates.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Statement scope:</strong> A name is in statement scope if it is defined within the <code>()</code> part of a <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>if</code>, or <code>match</code> statement. Its scope extends from its point of declaration to the end of its statement. All names in statement scope are local names.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Function scope:</strong> A label is in scope from its point of declaration until the end of the function.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A declaration of a name within a block can overshadow a declaration in an enclosing block or a global name. That is, a name can be redefined within a block to refer to a different entity. After exiting the block, the name resumes its previous meaning. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x = 5; // global x
fn f() {
    let x = 10; // local x hides global x
    {
        let x = 15; // hides first local x
    }
    x = 3; // assign to first local x
}
let p = &x; // take address of global x
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Shadowing names is unavoidable in large programs. However, it can be easy for a human reader to miss that a name has been shadowed, leading to subtle and difficult-to-find errors. To minimize these issues, avoid using generic names like <code>i</code> or <code>x</code> for global variables or local variables in large functions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A hidden global name can be referred to using the fully qualified path. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x = 5;
fn f2() {
    let x = 1; // hide global x
    crate::x = 2; // assign to global x
    x = 2; // assign to local x
    // ...
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There is no way to use a hidden local name.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The scope of a name that is not a struct member starts at its point of declaration, that is, after the complete declarator and before the initializer. This implies that a name can be used to specify its own initial value. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x = 97;
fn f3() {
    let x = x; // initialize x with its own (uninitialized) value
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A good compiler warns if a variable is used before it has been initialized.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is possible to use a single name to refer to two different objects in a block without using the <code>::</code> operator. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x = 11;
fn f4() {
    let y = x; // use global x: y = 11
    let x = 22;
    y = x; // use local x: y = 22
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Again, such subtleties are best avoided.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The names of function arguments are considered declared in the outermost block of a function. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f5(x: i32) {
    let x = 5; // error: name redefined
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This is an error because <code>x</code> is defined twice in the same scope.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Names introduced in a <code>for</code> statement are local to that statement. This allows the reuse of conventional names for loop variables. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f(v: Vec<String>, lst: Vec<i32>) {
    for x in &v {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    for x in &lst {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    for (i, item) in v.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("{}: {}", i, item);
    }
    for i in 1..=7 {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This contains no name clashes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A declaration is not allowed as the only statement in the branch of an <code>if</code> statement.
</p>

## 8.11. Initialization
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When initializing an object, the initializer determines its initial value. Various initialization styles exist, but clear and safe syntax is emphasized. Consider these examples for different initialization styles:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let a1 = X { v };
let a2: X = X { v };
let a3 = X { v };
let a4 = X::new(v);
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The first form is recommended for its clarity and reduced error potential. Other forms may appear in older codebases. Initializing a simple variable with a simple value can sometimes be seen, such as:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let x1 = 0;
let c1 = 'z';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, for more complex initializations, using the struct initialization syntax (<code>{}</code>) is preferable. This avoids narrowing conversions, which can cause issues:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">An integer cannot be converted to another integer type if it cannot hold the value.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">A floating-point value cannot be converted to another floating-point type if it cannot hold the value.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">A floating-point value cannot be converted to an integer type.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">An integer value cannot be converted to a floating-point type.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f(val: f64, val2: i32) {
    let x2 = val as i32; // if val == 7.9, x2 becomes 7
    let c2 = val2 as u8; // if val2 == 1025, c2 becomes 1
    let x3: i32 = val as i32; // ok, truncates val
    let c3: u8 = val2 as u8; // ok, truncates val2
    let c4: u8 = 24; // OK: 24 fits within u8
    let c5: u8 = 264; // error: 264 cannot be represented as u8
    let x4: i32 = 2.0 as i32; // ok, truncates 2.0
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using the <code>{}</code> syntax for initialization is preferred for avoiding potential issues with type inference:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let z1 = [99]; // z1 is an array with one element
let z2 = 99;  // z2 is an integer
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
You can define structs to be initialized with specific values. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Vector {
    data: Vec<i32>,
}

impl Vector {
    fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
        Vector { data: vec![0; size] }
    }

    fn from_value(value: i32) -> Self {
        Vector { data: vec![value] }
    }
}

let v1 = Vector::from_value(99); // v1 is a Vector with one element of 99
let v2 = Vector::new(99); // v2 is a Vector with 99 elements, each 0
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For most types, the empty initializer <code>{}</code> is used to indicate a default value:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x4: i32 = Default::default(); // x4 becomes 0
let d4: f64 = Default::default(); // d4 becomes 0.0
let p: Option<&str> = None; // p becomes None
let v4: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); // v4 becomes an empty vector
let s4: String = String::new(); // s4 becomes an empty string
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Most types have a default value. For integral types, the default is zero. For pointers, the default is <code>None</code>. For user-defined types, the default value is determined by the typeâ€™s implementation of the <code>Default</code> trait.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Direct initialization and conversion rules are strict to ensure type safety and prevent unexpected behavior. The <code>Default</code> trait and type inference play crucial roles in initializing variables with expected values, making the code safer and more predictable.
</p>

### 8.11.1. Missing Initializers
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For various types, especially built-in ones, itâ€™s possible to leave out the initializer. However, this can lead to complexities. To avoid these issues, consistently initializing variables is recommended. One main exception might be a large input buffer. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
const MAX: usize = 1024 * 1024;
let mut buf = [0u8; MAX];
some_stream.read(&mut buf[..]).unwrap(); // read up to MAX bytes into buf
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Initializing the buffer with zeros would incur a performance cost, which might be significant in some scenarios. Avoid such low-level buffer usage where possible, and only leave such buffers uninitialized if the performance benefit is significant and measured.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
If no initializer is provided, global, module-level, or static variables are set to their default values:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
static mut A: i32 = 0; // A becomes 0
static mut D: f64 = 0.0; // D becomes 0.0
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Local variables and heap-allocated objects are not initialized by default unless they are of types with a default constructor. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn f() {
    let x: i32; // x does not have a well-defined value
    let buf: [u8; 1024]; // buf[i] does not have a well-defined value
    let p = Box::new(0); // *p is initialized to 0
    let q = vec![0; 1024]; // q[i] is initialized to 0
    let s: String = String::new(); // s is ""
    let v: Vec<char> = Vec::new(); // v is an empty vector
    let ps = Box::new(String::new()); // *ps is ""
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you want to initialize local variables or objects created with <code>Box::new</code>, use the default initializer syntax:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn ff() {
    let x: i32 = 0; // x becomes 0
    let buf = [0u8; 1024]; // buf[i] becomes 0 for all i
    let p = Box::new(10); // *p becomes 10
    let q = vec![0; 1024]; // q[i] becomes 0 for all i
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Members of an array or a struct are initialized by default if the array or struct itself is initialized. Consistent initialization practices help ensure predictable behavior and can prevent subtle bugs.
</p>

### 8.11.2. Initializer Lists
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For more complex objects that need multiple initial values, Rust uses initializer lists within <code>{}</code>. Here are some examples:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let a = [1, 2]; // array initializer
struct S { x: i32, s: String }
let s = S { x: 1, s: String::from("Helios") }; // struct initializer
let z = Complex::new(0.0, std::f64::consts::PI); // using constructor
let v = vec![0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3]; // using list macro to create a vector
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
While the <code>=</code> is optional, some prefer to use it to clearly indicate that multiple values are initializing a set of member variables.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Function-style argument lists can also be used in certain cases:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let z = Complex::new(0.0, std::f64::consts::PI); // using constructor
let v = vec![3.3; 10]; // create a vector with 10 elements, each initialized to 3.3
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When declaring, an empty pair of parentheses <code>()</code> always signifies a function. To explicitly use default initialization, use <code>{}</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let z1 = Complex::new(1.0, 2.0); // function-style initializer (initialization by constructor)
fn f1() -> Complex<f64> { Complex::new(0.0, 0.0) } // function declaration
let z2 = Complex::new(1.0, 2.0); // initialization by constructor to {1.0, 2.0}
let f2 = Complex::<f64>::default(); // initialization by constructor to the default value {0.0, 0.0}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using <code>{}</code> notation ensures no narrowing conversions. When using <code>let</code> with an initializer list, the type is inferred:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let x1 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4]; // x1 is a Vec<i32>
let x2 = vec![1.0, 2.25, 3.5]; // x2 is a Vec<f64>
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, mixed types in a list will cause an error:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let x3 = vec![1.0, 2]; // error: cannot infer the type for a mixed initializer list
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, initializer lists in Rust provide a clear and concise method for initializing complex objects while ensuring type safety and avoiding narrowing conversions. Consistent use of these practices enhances code readability and reduces potential bugs.
</p>

## 8.12. Deducing a Type: `let` and `typeof`
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust provides robust mechanisms for type inference, streamlining the process of variable declaration and improving code readability and maintainability. Type inference in Rust allows the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it, eliminating the need for explicit type annotations in many cases. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where the type is evident from the context, thus reducing boilerplate code and potential errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>let</code> keyword in Rust is pivotal for type inference, allowing the declaration of variables without specifying their types explicitly. When a variable is declared using <code>let</code>, Rust examines the initializer expression to determine the variable's type. This type deduction applies to both mutable (<code>let mut</code>) and immutable (<code>let</code>) variables, providing flexibility and ease of use in various programming contexts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In more complex expressions, such as determining the return type of a function or the type of a struct member, the <code>typeof(expr)</code> function comes into play. This function evaluates the given expression and deduces its type, which can be particularly beneficial when dealing with intricate code structures or when the type is not immediately apparent.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's type inference is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. The <code>let</code> keyword and <code>typeof</code> function simply report the type that the compiler has already inferred from the expression, ensuring that the inferred type aligns with the expected type. This approach not only enhances code clarity but also leverages the compiler's rigorous type-checking capabilities to ensure type safety and consistency throughout the program.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By relying on type inference, Rust allows developers to write cleaner, more concise code while maintaining the language's strong emphasis on safety and performance. This feature is a testament to Rust's design philosophy, which aims to provide powerful abstractions without sacrificing control over low-level details.
</p>

### 8.12.1. The `let` Keyword for Type Inference
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When declaring a variable with an initializer, Rust allows you to omit the explicit type specification by inferring the type from the initializer. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let a1: i32 = 123;
let a2: char = 'z';
let a3 = 123; // a3 is inferred as i32
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the integer literal <code>123</code> is of type <code>i32</code>, so <code>a3</code> is automatically assigned the type <code>i32</code>. This type inference is especially beneficial when dealing with complex or non-obvious types. Consider this example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn example<T>(arg: Vec<T>) {
    for p in arg.iter() {
        println!("{:?}", p);
    }
    
    for p in &arg {
        println!("{:?}", p);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using type inference (<code>&arg</code> and <code>arg.iter()</code>) simplifies the code and enhances readability. It also ensures that the code adapts seamlessly if the type of <code>arg</code> changes. Explicitly specified types might need updating, but inferred types remain correct.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, relying solely on type inference can sometimes delay the detection of type errors, making debugging more challenging. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn example(d: f64) {
    let max = d + 7.0;
    let a = vec![0; max as usize]; // the type of max must be converted to usize
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In larger scopes, explicitly specifying types can help identify errors more effectively. If type inference causes confusion, breaking the function into smaller, more manageable parts is often beneficial.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
You can still use specifiers and modifiers with inferred types, such as <code>mut</code> and references. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn process_vector(v: &Vec<i32>) {
    for &x in v.iter() { // x is inferred as i32
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    
    for x in v { // x is inferred as &i32
        println!("{}", x);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In these cases, type inference (<code>let</code> keyword) is based on the type of elements in the vector <code>v</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust ensures that variables are implicitly dereferenced in expressions, preventing confusion and maintaining clarity. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn update_value(v: &mut i32) {
    let x = *v; // x is inferred as i32
    let y = v; // y is inferred as &mut i32
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach guarantees clear and accurate type handling within the code.
</p>

### 8.12.2. `let` and `{}` Lists
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When initializing variables, it's important to consider both the type of the variable and the type of the initializer. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let v1: i32 = 12345; // 12345 is an integer
let v2: i32 = 'c' as i32; // 'c' is a character
let v3: T = f();
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using <code>{}</code> for initialization helps prevent unintended conversions:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let v1: i8 = { 12345 }; // error: narrowing conversion
let v2: i32 = { 'c' as i32 }; // okay: implicit char to int conversion
let v3: T = { f() }; // works only if f() can be implicitly converted to T
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When using <code>let</code> with type inference, we only deal with the initializer's type, and the <code>=</code> syntax is typically safe to use:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let v1 = 12345; // v1 is an i32
let v2 = 'c'; // v2 is a char
let v3 = f(); // v3 is whatever type f() returns
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>=</code> syntax is often preferable with <code>let</code> because the <code>{}</code> syntax can lead to unexpected results:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let v1 = { 12345 }; // v1 is an i32
let v2 = { 'c' }; // v2 is a char
let v3 = { f() }; // v3 is of the type returned by f()
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider this example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let x0 = {}; // error: type cannot be deduced
let x1 = { 1 }; // x1 is an i32
let x2 = [1, 2]; // array of i32 with two elements
let x3 = [1, 2, 3]; // array of i32 with three elements
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The type of a homogeneous list of elements is determined by the type of the initializer. Specifically, the type of <code>x1</code> is deduced to be <code>i32</code>. If it were otherwise, the types of <code>x2</code> and <code>x3</code> could become ambiguous.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Therefore, it's advisable to use <code>=</code> for variable initialization with <code>let</code> unless you intend to initialize a collection or a list, ensuring clarity and preventing unintended type deductions. This practice maintains the safety and predictability of your code.
</p>

### 8.12.3. The `typeof()` Specifier
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We can use <code>let</code> when we have an appropriate initializer. However, there are instances where we need to deduce a type without initializing a variable. In these cases, we use the <code>typeof</code> specifier. This is especially useful in generic programming scenarios. For example, when writing a function to add two matrices with potentially different element types, we need to determine the type of the result. The element type of the sum should match the type resulting from adding elements from each matrix. Thus, the function can be declared like this:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn add_matrices<T, U>(a: &Matrix<T>, b: &Matrix<U>) -> Matrix<typeof(T::default() + U::default())> {
    let mut res = Matrix::new(a.rows(), a.cols());
    for i in 0..a.rows() {
        for j in 0..a.cols() {
            res[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j];
        }
    }
    res
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Within the function definition, we again use <code>typeof()</code> to describe the element type of the resulting matrix:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn add_matrices<T, U>(a: &Matrix<T>, b: &Matrix<U>) -> Matrix<typeof(T::default() + U::default())> {
    let mut res = Matrix::new(a.rows(), a.cols());
    for i in 0..a.rows() {
        for j in 0..a.cols() {
            res[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j];
        }
    }
    res
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>typeof(T::default() + U::default())</code> specifies the type of the elements in the resulting matrix, derived from adding corresponding elements from matrices <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using <code>typeof()</code> ensures that the result type is accurately deduced based on the operand types involved in the addition, making the code more flexible and adaptable.
</p>

## 8.13. Objects and Values
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In programming, objects refer to contiguous blocks of memory allocated to store data. These objects can be manipulated directly, whether they are explicitly named or allocated dynamically without direct references. For instance, you might interact with memory through expressions like <code>p[a + 10] = 7</code>, where <code>p</code> is a pointer and <code>a + 10</code> is an offset, which does not require explicit naming of the underlying memory block. Therefore, the term "object" is used to describe any block of memory used for storing data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
An object is fundamentally a region of storage, while an lvalue represents an expression that designates such an object. Originally, the term "lvalue" was defined as "something that can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment," indicating that the expression refers to a memory location where a value can be stored. However, not all lvalues are modifiable; some may refer to constants or immutable locations. In Rust, lvalues that are mutable and can be assigned new values are referred to as modifiable lvalues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is crucial to distinguish between this low-level concept of an object and more complex constructs like trait objects or polymorphic objects. While objects refer to raw memory storage, class objects and polymorphic objects represent higher-level abstractions built on top of this fundamental concept. Class objects often encapsulate both data and behaviors, while polymorphic objects support dynamic type operations and method dispatch.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding these concepts is essential for efficient memory management and safe data manipulation in Rust. Rust's strict type system and ownership model ensure that interactions with objects are predictable and controlled, thus preventing many common issues related to memory safety and concurrency.
</p>

### 8.13.1. Lvalues and Rvalues
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the concept of rvalue complements the idea of lvalue. While an lvalue represents a location in memory that can be assigned a new value, an rvalue is essentially any value that does not qualify as an lvalue. For example, a temporary value, such as the result of a function call or an intermediate calculation, is considered an rvalue. This distinction helps in understanding how values are handled in expressions and operations, particularly in terms of addressing, copying, and moving.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For an object, two critical properties are crucial in managing memory and ensuring correct behavior: identity and movability. An object with identity means that it has a distinct name, pointer, or reference that allows the program to determine its uniqueness and track changes to its value. In contrast, movability refers to the ability to transfer the object's value to another location while leaving the original object in a valid but unspecified state, rather than duplicating the object.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the combination of these properties results in four possible classifications of objects:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Movable with Identity (mi):</strong> These objects have a unique identifier and can be moved. For instance, owned data types like <code>Box<T></code> fall into this category.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Movable without Identity (m):</strong> These objects do not have a unique identifier and can be moved, such as temporary values returned from functions that are not directly accessible after the function call.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Not Movable but with Identity (i):</strong> These objects have a unique identifier but cannot be moved. An example might be references to data, which are fixed in place but have a distinct identity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Neither Movable nor with Identity (ni):</strong> This category is not typically required in practical programming, as it represents objects that do not have a unique identity and cannot be moved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By understanding these classifications, Rust developers can better manage object lifetimes, perform efficient memory operations, and adhere to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules. This nuanced approach helps in writing robust and reliable code, avoiding common pitfalls related to object manipulation and memory safety.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
An lvalue represents a location in memory that can be assigned a new value. It's essentially an expression that refers to a specific memory address. Think of an lvalue as a named variable or a reference to a piece of memory where you can read from or write to. For examples:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Variables: <code>x</code>, <code>my_array[2]</code>, <code>my_struct.field</code></p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">References: <code>&x</code>, <code>&mut x</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, lvalues are used when you need to assign a value to a specific place in memory. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let mut x = 5; // `x` is an lvalue
x = 10; // We can assign a new value to `x`
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>x</code> is an lvalue because it refers to a specific location in memory where a new value can be stored.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
An rvalue is any value that does not represent a specific memory location. Instead, it represents a value that can be used in an expression. Rvalues are often temporary and do not have a persistent memory address where you can store values. Here is the examples of rvalues:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Literals: <code>5</code>, <code>3.14</code>, <code>"hello"</code></p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The result of expressions: <code>x + 1</code>, <code>func()</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, rvalues are used in contexts where a value is needed but no assignment is required. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let y = 5 + 3; // `5 + 3` is an rvalue
let a = 10; // `a` is an lvalue; `10` is an rvalue
let b = a + 5; // `a + 5` is an rvalue; `b` is an lvalue where the result is stored
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>5 + 3</code> is an rvalue because it represents a value resulting from the addition operation but does not refer to a memory location.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the combination of lvalues and rvalues is fundamental to how values are assigned and used. Lvalues are expressions that refer to a specific memory location where a value can be stored or modified, allowing them to appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. This means lvalues are essentially placeholders or containers for data, such as variables or mutable references. In contrast, rvalues represent values or expressions that do not have a fixed memory location but instead yield a value that can be used in calculations or assignments. Rvalues typically appear on the right-hand side of an assignment, where they provide the value to be stored in an lvalue. For example, in the assignment <code>let x = 5 + 3;</code>, <code>5 + 3</code> is an rvalue that computes to <code>8</code>, which is then assigned to the lvalue <code>x</code>. Understanding this distinction helps manage data flow and memory effectively, ensuring that values are correctly assigned and manipulated within the constraints of Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Thus, a traditional lvalue is something with identity that can't be moved (because we could inspect it after a move), and a traditional rvalue is anything we're allowed to move from. The other categories are prvalue ("pure rvalue"), glvalue ("generalized lvalue"), and xvalue ("x" for "extraordinary" or "expert only"; there have been many imaginative suggestions for this "x"). For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut vs = vec![String::from("Hello"), String::from("World")];
    let v2 = std::mem::take(&mut vs); // move vs to v2
    // vs is now empty, and v2 has the values
    println!("{:?}", v2);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, <code>std::mem::take(&mut vs)</code> is an xvalue: it has identity (we can refer to it as <code>vs</code>), but we've explicitly allowed it to be moved from by calling <code>std::mem::take()</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For practical programming, thinking in terms of rvalue and lvalue is typically enough. Remember that every expression is either an lvalue or an rvalue, but not both.
</p>

### 8.13.2. Lifetimes of Objects
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The lifetime of an object begins when its constructor completes and ends when its destructor starts. Types without explicit constructors, like int, can be thought of as having default constructors and destructors that perform no actions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, the concept of an object's lifetime encompasses the duration from when it is initialized until it is cleaned up, and it is a crucial part of Rustâ€™s ownership system. Automatic objects are those that are created and destroyed automatically as they go in and out of scope. For instance, a variable declared within a function is an automatic object. It is created when the function is invoked and destroyed when the function exits, typically managed via the stack. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let x = 42; // `x` is an automatic object
    println!("{}", x);
} // `x` is destroyed here, when `main` function ends
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Static objects, on the other hand, are declared outside any function or within the <code>static</code> keyword inside a function or class. They are initialized once and persist for the entire duration of the program. They maintain the same memory address throughout the programâ€™s execution. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
static GREETING: &str = "Hello, world!";

fn main() {
    println!("{}", GREETING); // `GREETING` is a static object
} // `GREETING` persists until the program ends
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Free store objects are dynamically allocated using methods like <code>Box::new</code> or <code>Rc::new</code>. Their lifetime is controlled by the programmer, who must manage allocation and deallocation. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(42); // `x` is a free store object
    println!("{}", x);
} // `x` is deallocated here
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Temporary objects are used for intermediate results in expressions. They are generally created and destroyed automatically, with their lifetime extending through the full expression in which they are used:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x + 3; // `5 + 3` is a temporary object
    println!("{}", y);
} // Temporary objects from `5 + 3` are destroyed after `y` is used
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Thread-local objects, declared with the <code>thread_local!</code> macro, are specific to each thread. They are created when the thread starts and destroyed when the thread terminates, ensuring that each thread has its own instance of the object:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
thread_local! {
    static LOCAL_VALUE: RefCell<i32> = RefCell::new(0);
}

fn main() {
    LOCAL_VALUE.with(|val| {
        *val.borrow_mut() = 42;
        println!("{}", *val.borrow());
    });
} // `LOCAL_VALUE` is thread-local and will be destroyed with the thread
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Array elements and non-static class members have lifetimes tied to their parent objects. For example, elements of an array live as long as the array itself, and fields within a struct have lifetimes tied to the struct instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Container {
    data: [i32; 3],
}

fn main() {
    let c = Container { data: [1, 2, 3] }; // Array elements live as long as `c`
    println!("{:?}", c.data);
} // Array elements are destroyed when `c` is destroyed
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, objects in Rust are classified by their lifetimes into several categories. Automatic objects are created and destroyed with their enclosing function scope, typically allocated on the stack. Static objects, declared globally or using <code>static</code>, persist for the entire program's duration, maintaining the same memory address and potentially requiring synchronization in multi-threaded contexts. Free store objects, allocated on the heap using methods like <code>Box::new</code>, have their lifetimes controlled manually by the programmer. Temporary objects, used for intermediate values or const references, exist as long as needed for an expression and are automatically destroyed afterward. Thread-local objects are unique to each thread, created when the thread starts and destroyed when it terminates, ensuring thread-specific storage.
</p>

## 8.14. Type Aliases
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are instances when a new name for a type is needed. Some reasons for this include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">The original name is too lengthy, complex, or not visually appealing.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">A programming approach requires different types to have the same name within a specific context.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Simplifying maintenance by defining a specific type in a single place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
type Pchar = *const char; // pointer to a character
type PF = fn(f64) -> i32; // function pointer that takes a f64 and returns an i32
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similar types can have the same name defined as a member alias:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Vector<T> {
    type ValueType = T; // every container has a ValueType
}

struct List<T> {
    type ValueType = T; // every container has a ValueType
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Type aliases serve as synonyms for other types rather than distinct types. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let p1: Pchar = std::ptr::null();
let p3: *const char = p1; // fine
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If distinct types with the same semantics or representation are needed, consider using enums or structs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
An older syntax using typedef is also available for defining aliases. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
type Int32 = i32; // equivalent to "typedef i32 Int32;"
type Int16 = i16; // equivalent to "typedef i16 Int16;"
type PtoF = fn(i32); // equivalent to "typedef fn(i32) PtoF;"
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Aliases are beneficial for isolating code from machine-specific details. For instance, using <code>Int32</code> to represent a 32-bit integer can ease the process of porting code to different architectures:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
type Int32 = i64; // redefine for a machine with 64-bit integers
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>_t</code> suffix is a common convention for aliases (similar to typedefs). For example, <code>int16_t</code>, <code>int32_t</code>, and other such aliases can be found in the <code><stdint></code> header in C++. However, naming a type based on its representation rather than its purpose is not always ideal.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>type</code> keyword can also introduce a template alias. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
type Vector<T> = std::vec::Vec<T, MyAllocator<T>>;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, type specifiers like <code>unsigned</code> cannot be applied to an alias. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
type Char = char;
type Uchar = unsigned Char; // error
type Uchar = unsigned char; // correct
{{< /prism >}}
## 8.15. Immutability
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, mutability and immutability are fundamental concepts that influence how data can be accessed and modified. Immutability is the default in Rust, meaning that once a variable is bound to a value, that value cannot be changed. This immutability provides guarantees about the safety and predictability of code by ensuring that data cannot be altered unexpectedly. For instance, the following code snippet demonstrates an immutable variable:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let x = 5;  // x is immutable
// x = 10; // This line would cause a compile-time error because x cannot be changed
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the variable <code>x</code> is immutable, and any attempt to reassign a new value to <code>x</code> would result in a compile-time error, ensuring that the value of <code>x</code> remains consistent throughout its scope.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
On the other hand, mutability in Rust is explicit and must be declared using the <code>mut</code> keyword. This allows a variableâ€™s value to be changed after its initial assignment. Here is how you can declare and use a mutable variable:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust">}}
let mut y = 10;  // y is mutable
y = 20;          // This is allowed because y is mutable
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this case, <code>y</code> is mutable, and its value can be updated from <code>10</code> to <code>20</code> without any issues. The <code>mut</code> keyword must be used at both the variable declaration and any places where modifications are made.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's strict approach to mutability ensures safety by preventing data races and concurrency issues. For instance, if multiple references to a mutable variable were allowed, it could lead to inconsistent states. Rust addresses this with its borrowing rules, which ensure that while a mutable reference exists, no other references (mutable or immutable) to the same data are allowed. This rule is exemplified in the following code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
let mut z = 30;         // z is mutable
let z_ref = &z;         // Immutable reference to z
let z_mut_ref = &mut z; // Mutable reference to z, causes a compile-time error
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, attempting to create a mutable reference <code>z_mut_ref</code> while <code>z_ref</code> exists would result in a compile-time error, as Rust prevents multiple mutable references or a mutable reference alongside immutable ones.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, immutability offers significant benefits compared to C++, particularly in terms of safety and concurrency. One of the primary advantages is that Rust's immutability guarantees help prevent unintended side effects. In C++, mutable variables can be changed from anywhere in the code, leading to potential bugs that are hard to trace. Rust, by default, enforces immutability, requiring you to explicitly declare variables as mutable when needed. This helps developers catch errors at compile time, rather than at runtime, by ensuring that variables intended to be immutable cannot be altered accidentally.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another benefit of Rust's immutability is its impact on concurrency. Rust's ownership system, combined with its immutability guarantees, facilitates safe concurrent programming. Since immutable data cannot be changed, multiple threads can access and read the same data simultaneously without the risk of data races. In C++, managing concurrent access to shared mutable data often requires complex synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes, which can introduce performance overhead and increase the risk of deadlocks. Rust simplifies this by ensuring that immutable data is inherently thread-safe, allowing for more straightforward and efficient concurrent programming.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, immutability in Rust contributes to code clarity and maintainability. When a variable is immutable, it signals to other developers that its value should not change, making the code easier to understand and reason about. This is particularly useful in large codebases where tracking changes to variables across different parts of the code can be challenging. In contrast, C++'s flexible mutability can lead to unexpected modifications, making the code harder to follow and maintain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust also enforces strict borrowing rules, which work in tandem with immutability to ensure memory safety. Immutable references in Rust allow multiple parts of the code to read from the same data without the risk of one part inadvertently modifying it. This is in contrast to C++, where pointers and references can be freely modified, potentially leading to undefined behavior and difficult-to-diagnose issues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Overall, Rust's emphasis on immutability provides robust guarantees about data integrity and concurrency safety. It simplifies the development process by reducing the likelihood of bugs and making concurrent programming more manageable, which can be a complex and error-prone aspect of C++ programming.
</p>

## 8.16. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust programming, it's essential to adhere to the latest Rust documentation and Rust Reference for accurate and up-to-date information on language standards. This practice helps ensure that your code complies with Rust's evolving best practices and avoids pitfalls related to unspecified or undefined behavior. Rust's ownership and borrowing principles are fundamental to preventing issues with memory safety and data races. Following these principles diligently will help maintain predictable and consistent behavior across different platforms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When working with integers and character literals, it's important to avoid assumptions about their values or sizes. For example, Rust interprets integers with a leading zero as octal, and the size of integers can vary based on the platform. To avoid confusion and potential bugs, use clearly defined constants or enums instead of arbitrary values. This approach enhances code readability and reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, be cautious with floating-point numbers, as precision and range issues can lead to unexpected results. Prefer using <code>char</code> over <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> to avoid complications related to type conversion.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To maintain organized and clear code, declare only one item per statement and use concise names for local variables. Reserve longer names for global or less common variables to improve readability and avoid naming conflicts. Ensure that variable names are unique within their scopes and avoid using ALL_CAPS for variable names, as this convention is typically reserved for constants. When initializing structs, use Rust's <code>{}</code> initializer syntax, and for auto types, use the <code>=</code> sign. Always initialize variables before use and leverage type aliases to provide meaningful names for built-in types or to create new types using enums and structs. By following these practices, you ensure that your code is not only functional but also maintainable and easy to understand.
